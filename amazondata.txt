It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money.

It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.
5	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B00PWSAXAM	Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System - No Sensitivity	Only use twice a week	I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth.

15	__label1__	4	N	Furniture	B0019QITHK	Boss Caressoft Medical Stool, black	Color Is Accurate	I bought 2 of these in brown for my island. The hydraulic mechanism looks as though it might fail with over use, but otherwise, I really like them. The color is accurate, as is the description. There is some padding, but not much. Definitely not a chair that you would lounge around in, but great for a bar/counter in the kitchen.

I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far.
18	__label1__	4	N	Sports	B000HE8NK8	Barnett Diablo Slingshot	good enough	As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip.

I take it before breakfast, lunch and supper. I don't take the one after supper because I don't tend to eat much in the late evenings. I find it really cuts my down my appetite. I've lost 8 lbs this month, which is WAY more than I've lost in a long time.

26	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B0018KL0YG	Oregano Oil CERTIFIED ORGANIC- Joy of the Mountain - 75% Carvacrol (30mL) Brand: Joy of the Mountain	Did you know? Oregano delivers more antioxidants than blueberries, oranges or apples	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/wa7AI ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food.

We tried 2 before this one & took both back. You cannot feel the wires and the material is very luxurious. I did feel it was quite pricey...about $50 more than the ones we took back. However, that being said, the quality indicates it will last for years.

It will allow you to set your table very decoratively, and the beauty of a white dinnerware set is that it goes with any color scheme! Before acquiring this particular dinnerware set, I already owned a plain white set of dinnerware; but this set with the platinum rim is much nicer.

It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz	Since I have a low pain tolerance this facial hair remover didn't hurt very much. It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz, especially when wearing foundation. The tweezers were okay, loved the color but it was a little hard for me to use. Wish the package was bubble wrapped because it was so cute but mine got smashed in the process of shipping. Great customer service!!
35	__label1__	3	N	Camera	B0049I48JI	Nikon Deluxe Digital SLR Camera Case - Gadget Bag	hard to accommodate	The bag looks like a little smaller version than the one in the picture.

This mask is great for the purpose of keeping out the light for sure! My hubs gets up at 4am to go work and he is a butthead by turning on all the lights. Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on. For me I hate sleeping on my back so :(

39	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B005HXTMYA	Protocol For Life Balance - Red Yeast Rice Plus 600 mg 90 vcaps	The best natural product to lower cholesterol	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Zi8I , 600mg a tablet for only 5 cents, additional with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies have identified red yeast rice as a beneficial supplement for maintaining a healthy balance of cholesterol and related lipids in the body. Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.<br /><br />A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!

41	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B000F5PM4E	Elon Matrix 5,000 - Vitamin for Hair 60 tablets	My husband commented on how good my hair looks since I started this, thick, clear and even toned	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a "fat burner" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)

44	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B00028P640	Natural Factors Pycnogenol Pine Bark 25mg Capsules, 60-Count	The Gift of Life from Trees! Fountain of youth	My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />"So, tell me what it cant heal?" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help.

They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure.

She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch.

114	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B004Q8JH9M	Pampers Cruisers Diapers Size 4 Economy Pack Plus,160 Count	Good for mobility	We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too.

119	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B004Q8LL9Q	Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Economy Plus Pack Size 1, 276 Count	Good diaper on the right baby	There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.

I purchased Herbalife a few months ago at my local health retailer and had high hopes for this with the numerous good reviews I read. Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start! I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long to find something that worked for me.<br /><br />If you want to actually lose weight, take a look at this item here on Amazon and give it a chance ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1jSaoQQ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the product for you, I'm at least glad I could share my experience about this product and how it did not work for me. I am walking proof that there is SOMETHING out there that works!

If you want a fast acting balm that doesn't have the real effect, don't buy this. If you want something that will take some time but bring long term results, this is the best balm on the market.

156	__label1__	2	N	Sports	B000UEP0NI	FitDeck Bodyweight	Full and Complete Review of Fit Deck Bodyweight	I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.

I do a lot of running, and have recently began having some minor joint discomfort in my left knee and hip as a result of training for a marathon. After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running. It is a bit more expensive than I would like which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I have to admit it has really helped me out.

The look and feel of them is cool but there is definitely work to be done if these are to be sold for $100.<br /><br />After dealing with these I got myself a good headset that I absolutely love. The sound quality is great and I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over two months of use. I can wear them for hours on end with no issue!<br /><br />If you want a great headset, check out this pair here on Amazon -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qp9Fhd<br /><br />I hope I could help others out by sharing my experience with these headsets, you won't regret getting the pair I did!

Any tribulus product that contains 45% Saponins, is simply not going to compare to a tribulus that contains a high concentration of Protodioscin (the main ingredient responsible for the benefits I gets when taking tribulus).  The most potent form of tribulus is extracted at a ratio of 90%, [[ASIN:B007RLZDBQ Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 50 Grams]].  Even than I would still recommend combining it with some longjack or DAA, if increasing testosterone levels is your main motivation for taking it in the first place.

I am still learning the art of getting these molds filled correctly, but am starting to have a bit more success. I used the ice for the first time this week and I was a little bit non-plussed by the length of time they lasted. I was using the ice inside, in a controlled-temperature environment and I can't say that I noticed they lasted any longer than say, a cube from an actual ice cube tray. However ... I still think they are worth it because the look much cooler than a cube! I am eager to try using filtered water to see if I can get crystal clear ice balls. The ball is about the size of a golf ball. I would like it to be a bit bigger (I am starting to giggle as I write this) so you could plop one in a rocks glass instead of two. However, this size also fits in tall, slim glasses. They're fun! If you're serving drinks or just enjoy a good sip of Scotch, you should have these.

I was so sore that it was discouraging me from working out. I wanted to continue making great progress toward my goal but without the joint pain. I did some research and read several reviews about Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM. I decided to try Kirkland brand and it worked pretty well. Pain subsided a bit but my joints were still achy, but a definite improvement. These tablets are also really big and difficult to swallow. I found another supplement called Flexadrene that contains Glucosamine, Chondriotin and MSM along with over 20 other ingredients that relieve joint pain [[ASIN:B00NOG20ZK Flexadrene  Complete Joint Care Formula]]I have been taking these for a month and my joint pain is all but gone and my workout regimen is even more intense. Plus, the Flexadrene pills are much easier to swallow. Overall, this is a good product, but if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, I suggest trying Flexadrene.

282	__label1__	4	N	Books	006114844X	And Only to Deceive (Lady Emily)	Romantic, elegant mystery	The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />"Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me..."<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series.

289	__label1__	3	N	Books	1742205933	The World's Best Street Food: Where to Find it & How to Make it (Lonely Planet Street Food)	Made me nauseous	I don't know why but after seeing the images and reading this I felt like I wanted to hurl really bad. It was especially annoying since I just ate some excellent sushi and I was not about to waste a good salmon roll.

Just one pill a half hour before your meals and boom. You're losing weight and feeling better inside and out every day. At least thats the hope. For me it worked, I actually have a friend who bought them at the same time as me who hasnt had the results Ive had.. Not sure the deal but I can't be happier with what's happening with me.
291	__label1__	3	N	Baby	B004Y9AKZI	Graco Pack N Play Playard Bassinet with Automatic Folding Feet, Pasadena	easy set-up	We needed a second one (I have twin boys and they could share one when they were really young, but not anymore) and this one is a great buy for the money. All the features of Pack n Play - easy set-up, etc. for under my budget. You can hardly find one second-hand for that amount.
292	__label1__	2	N	Jewelry	B003G6EYI4	Sterling Silver Bangle Cuff Bracelet For European Style Large Hole Beads - Screw End 6.5 Inches	so uncomfortable.	This bracelet is gorgeous, but I found it so uncomfortable. I don't have large wrists, but my wrist bones do kind of stick out. No matter were I placed the cuff, it was hitting my wrist bones. I had to return it.
293	__label1__	4	N	Video DVD	6304711905	Tombstone	Best Western Movie	I absolutely love this movie!  In my opinion it is the best western movie out there.  Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are great actors. This movie is going to get watched over and over and over.  haha
294	__label1__	4	Y	Beauty	B00HJDIAGC	Shine Whitening Teeth Whitening Kit Bundle with 2 5cc Syringes and 2 Mouth Trays	I really feel it  slight sensitivity	I feel some stinging in my teeth every time I use this product. And I know it really works though, because Ive seen my teeth get a lot whiter. Overall Im happy with this, and have no major complaints.
295	__label1__	4	N	Home	B003XJC9FY	Reliable Enviromate P7 Pronto Portable 4-Bar Pressure Hand Held Steam Cleaner and Fabric Steamer	Easy to use	I use this product to steam clean our curtains, my daughter's stuffed animals/throw pillows when I can't or don't have time to wash them. Easy to use. It's easy enough to use but it tends to get a little heavy when doing larger jobs but that would be the case with any appliance.
296	__label1__	4	N	Apparel	B0073MLZ70	Alpine Swiss Mens Leather Flipout ID Wallet Bifold Trifold Hybrid Black	High-Quality Materials	Once again, dealing with them was a pleasure. It is a handsome and functional wallet, well made from high-quality materials. I expect it to give years of good service.
297	__label1__	4	N	Books	0316055433	The Goldfinch: A Novel (Pulitzer Prize for Fiction)	Deeply entertaining in a superfluous sort of way	Perhaps it's because I'm surrounded with a dense miasma of collective pop culture references all day, but I found The Goldfinch quite captivating. It's good to suspend the more intense inclinations of the mind and simply allow it to be submerged in the story. On the other hand, I can understand the disappointment that some might feel if they think that the quality did not meet their expectations.
298	__label1__	4	N	Home Improvement	B003LVZ3MU	Mark Feldstein & Associates B4PBT 4-Inch Flameless Candle Pillar with Timer and Gift Box, Green Fresh Cut Bamboo	Adds to decor	Really like these candles. Gave 2 for gifts and kept one for myself. Elegant looking and works great. Enjoying the timer option and fact that I can put in a location you would never be able to put a real candle. Put inside TV stand and adds to decor.

The fact this is waterproof is a major plus, as we do get rain and showers during the months my vegetable garden is planted and grown. I am just really happy that the squirrels and skunks don't beat me to my garden grown vegetables, and I would highly recommend this item.
300	__label1__	4	N	Kitchen	B002PY7AYS	Thermos Stainless King 16-Ounce Travel Tumbler, Midnight Blue	Worth spending the money	I never thought I would ever pay as much as $20 for a travel mug. But I really got tired of making coffee in the morning and having it be lukewarm by the time I got to work. This mug is the perfect solution. Overall a well-made product that I hope to enjoy for a long time.
301	__label1__	4	N	Home	B002BDV8DC	La Crosse Technology WT-8005U-S Atomic Digital Wall Clock with Indoor Temperature, Silver	So far it is good	The display is large enough to read from across the room, even in daylight. So far it is very accurate and is happy it has a built in battery for backup, as we sometimes get momentary power hits.
302	__label1__	4	N	PC	B007RIFKUS	ASUS SABERTOOTH Z77 LGA 1155 Intel Z77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard	motherboard	I decided to spend a few extra bucks for the peace of mind of knowing this thing was going to work without hassle. Once again, ASUS didn't let me down. Put in my i7-3770k and everything started up with no problems.
303	__label1__	3	N	Watches	B0045ZUY16	GGI International Men'sLava Black Stainless Steel Lava RED LED Digital Bracelet Watch	can't really see the LED outside in sunlight	I have wanted this watch for a long time now and finally made my purchase. I didn't like that you can't really see the LED outside in sunlight. It's OK when's the sun goes down or if you're in a nightclub. I won't return it because of the cheap price and it makes a good conversational piece.
304	__label1__	4	N	Outdoors	B004060D8Y	Suunto Zoop Air/Nitrox Wrist Computer SS015964000	Nice watch...	Nice watch for my friend's kid. I received it on time and in an excellent condition. Kids like it. I would recommend this as a good item to gift someone especially kids.
305	__label1__	4	Y	Wireless	B00CC9P1K6	niceeshop(TM) Universal Mini Folding Plastic Smartphone Stand Holder (Black)+Capacitive Stylus- Black	sexy and minimalist.	i like how minimalist this stand is, it doesnt take up much space and it looks very classy as well. One thing i hate about it though is that its difficult to adjust the inclination, its because the stand its self doesnt hold especially when you have a glass table.
306	__label1__	4	N	Outdoors	B00012M5MS	Schwinn Thrasher Adult Micro Bicycle black/grey Helmet (Adult)	actually comfortable	This is actually comfortable and not at all like my last helmet which was incredibly distracting whenever my husband and I would go out cycling.
307	__label1__	1	N	Electronics	B000VEP3XO	Rocketfish Universal Wireless Rear Speaker Kit RF-WHTIB-A	Drops signal	The unit worked fine initially. However from day 2 on the signal drops every 20 minutes. I have to power cycle either the transmitter or receiver to get the units synced up again.
308	__label1__	3	N	Kitchen	B00HEYJ088	Brita 10 Cup Grand Water Pitcher with 1 Filter, BPA Free, Green	Hold it in place when pouring	This is my second Brita pitcher. The second time around I decided to go big and it is working out ok. The problem with this company is that they seem incapable of producing a lid that fits correctly. You have to hold it in place when pouring (it doesn't fit snugly; one end always sticks up). Same thing occurred with first one I owned. And yes, they were that way right out of the package. Quality control is sorely lacking at Brita. But for the price, the filter does its job so it's an acceptable product and I will keep it.
309	__label1__	4	N	Grocery	B0050NTYXG	HERSHEY'S Halloween Snack Size Assortment (36.22-Ounce Bag, 100 Pieces)	Delicious but a bit expensive	Delicious candies, it comes very well packed, so the taste of each kind of candy was good. My only complaint is that after I purchased them, I found the same package for a better price by several dollars.
310	__label1__	2	N	Kitchen	B00CBFADL8	Thermos 12 Ounce Tritan Hydration Bottle, Clone Wars	My son was disappointed	I love the Yoda design but not the functionality of this bottle. But was disappointed because it leaked after several use.

I was looking this with first interest buy this ... I can not buy this because I do not trust it. Please check the pictures, and the company website. This is not for Sprint Samsung GalaxyS3 4200mAh is not showing there. From where is this information?
312	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B001QX4GDC	Conair Professional Hair Brush Set	Not Bad	This brush isn't bad for getting through tangles, although it does stick a little when you have thicker hair. When wet, it seems to be more difficult to use. All around, the brushes are pretty decent for use on your hair.
313	__label1__	4	Y	Beauty	B00GYF65TK	OZNaturals Eye Gel - Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles - This Anti Wrinkle Eye Gel Was Voted ALLURE MAGAZINE'S Best In Beauty - The Most Effective Anti Aging Eye Cream Available!

I'm enjoying swimming more often now compared before, i hate latex and I'll never wear one again. Silicone is the thing because it's comfortable to use, doesn't wear out easily and it's cheaper. This cap is durable and very good at keep my hair dry, I love the style as well and the toughness of the silicone. I'll be recommending it to my friends!
317	__label1__	4	N	Office Products	B00006IDM7	Mead Composition Book, Wide Ruled, 9.75 x 7.50 Inch Sheet Size, Black Marble, Bookbound, 100 Sheets (09910)	Wrote down two successful business ideas on this guy!	I carry it around with me and jot down every idea that pops into my mind whenever something comes in that I dont want to forget. Ive been able to start two small (grass roots) businesses that have come up from nothing with all ideas written down in this notebook. Thanks!

320	__label1__	4	N	Baby	B007NG5UF4	VTech DM221 Safe & Sound Digital Audio Baby Monitor	Sound quality is good	This is an awesome baby monitor IF you keep it plugged in constantly, it doesn't last very long off the charger and if you shut it off the monitor, you may as well just plug it in cuz if you turn it back on, it's dead. But sound quality and everything is wonderful.
321	__label1__	4	Y	Beauty	B00NQGWFCQ	Retinol Serum 2.5% - Anti Aging & Anti Wrinkle Face Serum to Help with Lines and Spots - Enhanced with Best Natural Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea, Vitamin E & Jojoba Oil for Day or Night Use - Body Merry	My face is tighter and more youthful!	I use the Pro-A Serum every other day. I apply  about a dime sized amount to my face and neck after completely washing and drying my face. It has no smell at all. It is a thicker serum, almost gel like. It absorbs well into my face and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I love the results I am getting from the Pro-A serum. My skin is tighter and more firm. It feels softer and more moisturized then it has in a long time. My lines and wrinkles are going away, and I just feel younger, knowing that my face looks better.
322	__label1__	3	N	Lawn and Garden	B009Z6CW7O	Renogy 100 Watts 12 Volts Monocrystalline Solar Panel	low quality and fragile	I had high hopes when I saw that this one was of the bestselling solar panels here. I read most of the reviews here, and decided to purchase one for my house. Once they arrived, I managed to install them and for the first day I didn't had any problem - only thing was that I noticed that panels were of low quality and fragile. Second day the charge controller broke for no apparent reason, I just saw it broken and since I couldn't fix it myself -I called support - which, by the way, was not helpful. I returned the panels and asked for a refund, because they didn't wrote in the description how fragile these were :/.<br /><br />I listened to my friend's advice, who's a solar repairman, and I bought, like he did, a Suntastic Charger ( http://amzn.to/1Ad27Vf ) which I received 4 days ago. It's strange how I never experienced any problem with these - the material was good and firm - and charger was much more practical than of the Renogy.

327	__label1__	2	N	Beauty	B003RR4A2M	Turboion Rbb Croc Classic Straightener, Black Titanium Plates, 1.5 Inch	died	I used this with no problem, issues, didn't drop it, etc the day before then went to use it yesterday and it will not turn on. It just literally died. They said they have no warranty. So after only 6 months of very infrequent use, just died. Would not buy again without a warranty from a company that offered one.
328	__label1__	1	N	Baby	B0011URFRE	Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix	couldn't release the buckle sometimes and it's not solid...	I wouldn't recommend this baby seat to anyone who wants a safety to his kid. Once I got it, I put it into my car, because I had to drive my kid to the kindergarten, and once I arrived, the buckle just stuck - for no apparent reason. After a 3 minute fight I managed to free my kid from a seat and it was a disappointing experience. It happened 4-5 times after, so in the end I called support and asked them for help. They didn't had concrete solution, so I returned the item and got a refund.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I bought 65LX Seat ( http://amzn.to/1xthVzA ), because a colleague who had a 6 yr old kid said he bought it too and never had any problem with it. Once I got it - a week ago - I never had any problems with buckles, and since it had positive reviews here I wondered why I didn't purchase it prior to this one.
329	__label1__	4	N	Luggage	B004FMHO3U	Rockland Luggage Melbourne 3 Piece  Set, Orange, Medium	perfect ~ almost	Each luggage is perfect for everyone in my family. It is big enough and everything we need can fit on it. It is perfect for everyday get-outs or out-of-town trips. The only thing that I don't like about it is the wheels because they don't seem to be durable. I have this for 2 months already but I still don't trust the wheels. They look as if they will be broken for some time. But aside from that, everything is good already.
330	__label1__	4	N	Video Games	B009DYCTY4	PS3 250 GB Black Friday 2012 Bundle	Great price	They went out of stock in the stores nearby over night. Getting it online is the best thing to do if you don't mind waiting a little. Perfect combination of product and price too...my grandson is going to go ballistic!
331	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B00557OUEU	Life-Flo Oil, Pure Almond, 16 Ounce	Good Massage Oil	I am a massage therapist and I use almond oil at my job on a daily basis. The oil really helps soothe the skin, especially when you're working with clients who are exposed to the elements a lot. I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- [[ASIN:B00AJFV8L6 NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz]]. It really helps soften the skin in those extra hard places.<br /><br />I use the stuff at home too. One dab of each oil in the morning give my hands a soft feeling throughout the day whether I'm working or not. It's great on faces and for some clients, they've told me they use it in their hair as well. The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use!

333	__label1__	4	N	Home	B004U7V38W	Oil Rubbed Bronze Curved Shower Rod - NO SAWING REQUIRED	Very nice shower curtain rod	This is a very nice shower curtain rod. The color is a nice dark brown color. The only issue that I would caution is that the finish is painted on, and does scratch if you are not careful with your hooks/slides.

336	__label1__	3	N	Health & Personal Care	B0071O15DO	Lipozene Diet Pills - Maximum Strength Fat Loss Formula - 1500mg - 30 Capsules	works ok	This is a good product. I have been using it exclusively for 6 months or so and saw some solid weight loss. (3-4lbs a month) I have since switched over to a product called LipoPhen which seems to work much better, and I am now seeing 7-8lbs of fat loss per month. If you are a looking for a really intense fat burner/appetite suppressant, I would check out LipoPhen [[ASIN:B00I8ULAD0 LipoPhen - Advanced Weight Loss Supplement]] or LipoDream [[ASIN:B00I8US55G LipoDream - Non-Stimulant Advanced Weight Loss Supplement and Sleep Aid]].
337	__label1__	4	Y	Kitchen	B00YFPXB9I	Cheese Grater with Storage Bag, Hand Held Parmesan Cheese Grater	Easy To Use	I'm really enjoying having a smaller hand held cheese grater. It's much easier to clean and use then my older stand up grater. I use this to grate cheese right on top of homemade pizza and salads instead of having to use the larger grater and a bowl or a plate. I also love that it is dishwasher safe and comes with a storage pouch so I don't cut my hands on it when it's in my utensil drawer.
338	__label1__	4	Y	Wireless	B00NHG0374	Coromose Smile LED USB Charger Cable for Samsung Galaxy S3 S4 I9500 (Hot Pink)	Good quality!	Good quality USB cable, such as a color change indication can tell at a glance if the full load management, but also a very reasonable price, I will have a time when they do so.

Like how you can save a few dollars by buying the set. The serum goes on silky smooth, absorbs well and not greasy. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized all day long. Can notice an improvement in the wrinkles too. The eye cream is very nice too. Soft and absorbs nicely into my skin. Skin around my eye area looks brighter and less wrinkly. Going to buy again.

They are very basic but that is all that you'll need. They have the right format for most letters and are not that expensive.

345	__label1__	2	Y	Pet Products	B00R2Q2VS4	KONG Squeezz Crackle Ball, Medium, Colors may vary	It is made form light weight plastic and very easy to eat	This lasted a bit longer than the crackle bone I think simply because it is round.  It is made form light weight plastic and very easy to eat.  My girl and 11 month old puppy was able to eat this in under 10 minutes.  I was hoping it was harder plastic like the normal kong toys but not so.  If you have a chewer - don't waste the money.<br /><br />If your pup doesn't chew and just plays then I would say go for it.  But, if they are a chewer - they will eat it in short order.
346	__label1__	2	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00BZC2BE0	Protein Milkshake Vanilla Whey Protein Powder, 1 LBS, Approx 15 servings	Seems like a great company but was not impressed with the product	The powder certainly smelled sweet and vanilla-like but I wouldn't describe it as a vanilla milkshake.  The fake sugar taste was really really apparent so possibly the plain variety would be better.  Although the company was really nice to send me a sample, I was disappointed and wouldn't order this.
347	__label1__	1	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00NAV9CPA	Great Value Tech® E Series Replacement For Philips Sonicare Essence, Xtreme, Elite and Advance (4-pack)	NOT WORTH THE IMPLIED SAVINGS	These heads do not vibrate any where near as strong as the original Philips Sonicare heads.  Not worth the savings as I had to go buy a brand name repalcement from Walmart after trying these.

However, there were a few places, specifically the juicer parts where flash plastic got in the way of using the product. The build is solid and it feels good in the hand!

If you don't attempt to clean it while its hot, you may as well throw it away. There is no temperature setting either so it cooks everything fast or it will leave burn marks on your food. I so wanted to like this product because I wanted to eat healthier but this product doesn't live up to expectations.

I have been using other expensive brands but came across this brand while shopping on Amazon, wish I had not made that huge mistake for falling for the reviews & cheap price. Within few minutes of applying this on my face my whole face broke out I mean major break out & my face turned all red and hot it's been a week now and I can still see patches of red dry skin on my face and forehead. I am absolutely positive that this is not pure argan oil , it is either mixed with sunflower oil or cut with other cheap mineral oils, I have never had this bad experience before with pure argan oil and I have been using argan oil for 2+ years now, the only time my skin would have a reaction or break out is if anything had either sesame oil or coconut oil in it or when the products contained mineral oils. We also noticed that this oil very thin compared to other expensive brands and my husband is researching this product and is trying to find a local lab so we can send this bottle to be tested to see what all stuff this oil contains.

You can leave the coffee pod empty and it makes a hot cup of water for tea. I've also used this product to warm up baby bottles instead of boiling water. I've used my keurig at least 3 times a day for over 2 years and haven't had one problem yet. The price is high for a coffee maker, but it literally last forever. I highly recommend this product.

I think that caffeine in this product irritated my already sensitive eyes a bit. I normally don't have any issues with Passport to Organics products, and I have found the Zinc Eye Cream to be wonderful and very moisturizing for the winter.

How do we know they actually do that? That is just sketch. Any company that did this, I just had to look further into. Check out their Krill Oil product reviews, other customers had similar complaints about fake reviews.<br /><br />SO LOOK AT ALL FAKE THE 5-STAR REVIEWS! Why have these customers only reviewed Viva Labs products, or sometimes nothing else. It's a little bit weird when you start to look at it. The easy answer is the reviews for charity donation bribe.<br /><br />Started to look into the company. Another reviewer pointed out that they were a Kentucky corporation but were foreign owned. It is easy enough to do a google search, so I did one but I did not find a facility. I only saw the generic office park. This is some sort of shell company or something? Even more strange. Where is their location at? Where do they make this stuff and where does it come from?<br /><br />Too many weird occurances for me to put it into my body.
412	__label1__	3	N	Books	0983624534	Hell	Filthy Language	The author of "Hell" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.<br /><br />In "How to Stop Believing in Hell" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list.

It's a perfect lens for bird photography and candid photos.<br /><br />The aperture for me is not an issue because you can still produce a BOKEH when in f4.. not much but its okay.. I also tried the 70-200 f2.8 and it's way more better. It's a good telephoto lens for the price..

I find it very convenient especially in the morning because I am notorious for running late. K-cups make it really easy to measure and be on the run. Green tea is my favorite flavor and bigelow is amongst my favorite brand. I find these cups to be flavorful and not dull like so many alternatives. I also appreciate that it's not sweetened to death like some green teas.<br /><br />There are always those mornings where a little extra flavor can't hurt. Adding a dash of green tea powder {[[ASIN:B009PICJTS All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]} gives me the extra hit I'm looking for as well as a jolt of natural energy. I much prefer tea to coffee or other stimulants. Plus I don't have any crash which is always important. I don't need the extra always, but it's nice to have it and be able to add it accordingly without challenge.

So I got a joystick and saw that it doesn't receives any signal from helicopter. Firstly, I thought that it's because of batteries, logically, but the batteries were in, so I was confused. I told Amazon what I got and they said that I return the item and choose new one, because this one was out of stock :((.<br /><br />I choose another Helicopter which was far more better, It's Mini Radio RC Helicopter (http://amzn.to/12NArYx) which is cool and which worked from the first time I bought it :). In the end, my kid was happy to see it on air, so I was also :)).

In my first week I managed to drop 5 pounds and I was very excited because I thought I'd found my miracle pill. The week after that I actually gained 3 of those pounds back even though I was doing the exact same routine. The third week I've managed to lose 4 more pounds from where I was in week 2. It's hard to say if I'm going to get consistent results from these at this point. I'm going to go ahead and finish off the bottle and possibly try another one. For now I'm giving it 3/5 because it's clearly working and helping me lose weight, I just can't figure out why it fluctuates so damn much.

I have washed these a few times and no shrinkage at all, which is what I wanted. The cotton sheets I have been buying will shrink after a few washings making it difficult to put the fitted sheet on the bed. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they do not breathe like cotton and we have found them a little warm to sleep in. Other than that they are very nice sheets.

Not much, not enough to be even really concerned. It is a very effective product.    That said, I do like using this. It creates a lot of heat and perspiration. That has meant some loss of weight already, although I wonder if this is simply water, rather than the fat we are promised. Will return after more time and report my final findings. All in all, a recommended product, just make sure to use properly.

So I'm giving this 4 stars and will update to 5 if my results continue even without nutrition (I don't like changing what I eat). In any case, so far I've lost a good amount of weight and my stomach definitely looks better.<br /><br />P.S. For the one reviewer who didn't like some of the other reviews here. I bought this product on the baladea website and reviewed it since I always review my purchases here. It's not very nice to call people dishonest without any evidence. I recommend you try the product and write a comment based on that.

That being said, I feel like this one size fits all thing is not working, every time I keep finding myself pulling up the waist since it likes to sag down a bit. It has become very annoying since short skinny girls will not be able to do any good exercise like they want to. Forget about running, you will find yourself like one of those saggy pants guys that have no belts. The texture is okay but not great, surely not for the price. In the mean time I will be looking at other better designed leggings

We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price.  We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results.  A friend of my  Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up.  He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam.  He also showed us some other company's products and said they were certified by a USA water quality company and there were several companies like this that guaranteed their products.  Watch out for this company Air, Water and Life and boycott them.

502	__label1__	3	N	Books	0765342405	Ender's Shadow (The Shadow Series)	A pale sequal to Ender's game	Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.

506	__label1__	3	N	Wireless	B0023RRCP4	Wilson Electronics  DB Pro Indoor Cellular Signal Booster Kit for the Entire House - Retail Packaging - Gray (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install	This does not work with T-Mobile 4G! I purchased this based on the item description, which says that it works with all major cell phone companies in the US, with some listed exceptions. T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install. Wilson's requires a cable between the two, and took hours to install.

I did not see any improvements once so ever.<br /><br />I bought this based on all the glowing 5 star reviews, I come to find out, and upon closer inspection that most reviews look scripted and Fake. Total waste of $$

544	__label1__	1	N	Home	B003O970PW	Frigidaire FRA086AT7 8,000 BTU Window-Mounted Compact Air Conditioner with Temperature Sensing Remote	DOES NOT WORK!!! Room stays hot no matter what!!!!	I purchased this Air Conditioner last month as a bed room air conditioner. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is it's such a pain to have it fit correctly in the window. The instructions are unhelpful and do not explain anything. When I did get it to sit correctly, I noticed it would not even keep a small bedroom cool on only 80 degree days. I tried everything I possibly could but didn't get any sort of result I was looking for.<br /><br />After talking to friends and family, I finally found an air conditioner that works AMAZING!!! I have never slept better in my life now that the weather has been heating up this past month and can't wait to sleep in a cool room all summer long!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY air conditioner, check this one out here on Amazon -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1hsKRDg<br /><br />It's not as cheap but is well worth the extra money, as it cools quickly and efficiently. Also, it's much quieter!<br /><br />If you decide it's not the air conditioner for you, at least I got to share my story about this one!

If you are using the carseat on the plane, the bag must be carried down the aisle of the plane, it is too large to roll down.

552	__label1__	4	N	Tools	B0056C6XIA	Gerber Bear Grylls Survival Tool Pack [31-001047]	It works for me!	This gerber multitool is a great toy for me! My wife purchased this for a Christmas gift, and I don't think I've been this excited over something so simple! The sheath is very well designed, with a "rubber" loop that can be attached/re-attached without taking your belt off. My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access. I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire. I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.<br /><br />The flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months. The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you. I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, "rough" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.<br /><br />Once that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick! I've been asked why not just use a lighter. Well, I can, but it's not nearly as much fun, and not rewarding at all!<br /><br />Pricy? perhaps... but to me, it's already paid for itself and then some!

It allows you to train the remote to control other devices (I added my Element TV and my DirecTV cable box/DVR). The Pulse  is small and easy to hide near your TV. I attached the Pulse to the back of TV screen. The remote is nice. It has a touch pad and QWERTY boards. It looks OK but feels great. If Pulse can put touch pad and keyboard at the same side, it will be better.<br /><br />Now I have Netflix, YouTube, Chrome, Crackle, Pandora, NYtimes, Flixster, Snagfilm.<br />There is a App spotlight, it includes a lot of apps. Most of them are linked to website. But I enjoy it since they are free and I can enjoy them on my LG TV connected via HDMI cable.I can show my picasa pictures on my big screen with Photo App. It includes picasa and Flickr since I setup picasa account only.Chrome works great with touchpad remote but it is not easier than my computer. I have to flip remote all the time.<br /><br />I have smart tv features on my old big TV with just one hundred dollars. So happy with my decision and I love my Pulse.

I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----> http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.

I bought the collar as an additional training tool but as soon as I started using it I realized I would never need anything else. My dog started to respond quicker to my commands and behaved himself when he met stranger. The collar works like a charm and if it's good enough to train a male Rottweiler it should be good enough for all other breeds.

611	__label1__	1	N	Home	B00NAX7H78	Silhouette Cameo -- Starter Bundle	there's no repair center and machine goes off every 20 minutes...	Don't bother buying this cutting machine, because you'll end up with wasting a good money on something that cannot be repaired. Once I got the package, I wanted to install the machine via internet updates, and after I connected (hardly) online I download the latest software, but the problem was not in that. The problem was that, in every 20 minutes, machine goes off for no apparent reason. The worst thing is that the Silhouette repair center DOESN'T EXIST. so no one could repair this machine. I ended up as returning this item to Amazon...<br /><br />Once I got a refund, I bought Cricut Explore ( http://amzn.to/13Njs94 ) cutting machine which was far more better than Silhoutte version. I didn't had any problems in installing it and the fact that it comes with battery that last for 2-3 hours is really something that beats Silhouette version :).

Once I got them I noticed a hard focus - I couldn't set a proper distance, one which would be proper for my eyesight and binoculars. The more troubling problem was that there was some scratch inside the optics, so every object around me looked fuzzy. This was really a hard disappointing experience for me, so I asked for a refund.<br /><br />However I bought a Bushnell Binoculars (http://amzn.to/13xDW5q), because of a friendly suggestion.

Water isn't pumped up to the TOP of the filter like COMPETITOR PRODUCTS.  Several reviewers compensate for the top of the filter being dry by rotating it 180º each time they fill the jug.  This wouldn't be necessary IF there was a pump that pumped water from the tank to the TOP of the filter.<br /><br />2.

When I was doing my photo shoot last week, I decided to use these instead of my Opteka reflectors.  And guess what?  They work about the same, except the Neewer reflectors are a whole lot cheaper.  And the way they direct the light on my models when I'm shooting is wonderful.  I was taken by the first photo, and I expect to be using these for a long time.  The only thing I hate is fooling with the zipper on the tote bag.  It's not faulty; you just have to take your time to line the zipper up and it will work every time.

665	__label1__	4	N	Baby	B004X0WBHS	Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball	Not Quite What I Expected	When I first purchased this product, I was under the assumption it would be a great teething toy for my 6 month old girl.  The toy had a variety of shapes and contrasting colors sure to keep my child occupied for a while.  After a few weeks of playing with the toy, I realized my baby didn't have much interest in it anymore.  First of all, the toy requires more motor skills than most 6 month olds have.  The squeaky ball sometimes gets stuck and makes it hard to push the squeaker.  The toy is also real heavy, and I'm concerned it will fall on my child's face when she's lying down trying to play with it.  Her foot also gets stuck between the bars when she's really active. The paint on the caterpillar started coming off by the time she reached 8 months old.  It's okay to use if your child is actually interested in it and able to maneuver it. However, it seems that by the time your child is actually old enough to do the toy some justice, all interest in playing with it is gone.  As far as a teething toy is concerned, I would have rather invested in a rattler.

671	__label1__	1	N	Sports	B00169CU66	Total Gym XLS  Universal Home Gym for Total Body Workout	Watch out! READ THIS BEFORE BUYING PLEASE!!!	I thought this would be a good investment a couple months ago, but I was wrong...<br /><br />The first main issue I noticed with this set is that the bolts tend to loosen during use and when it happened to me, part of the frame bent because it wasn't supported properly anymore.<br /><br />The parts seem too cheap to be on a machine that costs $500+, which makes me even wonder why it costs so much. Not only that, but it is also very loud during use and smells like a chemical plastic spell.<br /><br />After I had to deal with this, I did some research and found an home gym I was more confident would be better and exactly what I was looking for. Luckily it has been the best machine I've ever used to work out with!<br /><br />It doesn't have any of the issues I mentioned above and I can't find a thing to complain about in over a month!<br /><br />I got it here on Amazon too -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r7KMGa<br /><br />You won't regret getting that setup, but if you don't get it, at least I could warn you about this one after my experience!

But with that being said, my weight has always fluctuated quite a bit so it's hard to tell whether Garcinia really is as life changing for me as many other users are reporting. Maybe it's my metabolism or my eating habits (I usually skip breakfast and lunch, but go by on coffee until a light meal around 3pm and then eat a bigger meal in the evening). I started taking the Garcinia with my main evening meal but so far I can't tell whether it has really helped me. I will give it another month and then maybe switch to green coffee bean extract.

The splash guard is almost non-existent and the opening for the potty is very small. My son is at the top of the growth chart for his height and weight. In order to get any use from the almost non-existent splash guard, he has to sit too far back on the potty and because the opening of the potty is very small, his bottom is part way off the potty.

Yet another little pleasant surprise: the button has a rubberized bottom so it doesn't slide around easily on the desktop.

754	__label1__	4	N	Kitchen	B004VF0G3G	LG LCSP1110ST 1.1 Cu Ft Counter Top Combo Microwave and Baking Oven, Stainless Steel	Perfect for a Bachelor or Bachelorette	This microwave came with plastic shrink wrapped over it. Sort of a thick shrink wrap which you have to remove. It's hard to tell it's there and it's a chore to get off. In fact, it appears they shrink wrapped the parts before they put it together, because the plastic stuff is in the seems where the oven is put together and that you can't get out. I never would have noticed it was there, but it covers the vents.<br /><br />Okay, once the thick plastic wrap is off, how does the microwave perform? As good as any other and it's attractive, but it's small, the interior I mean. I expected larger. The pizza oven could be bigger. The large frozen pizzas we get at Safeway are too big for it. Still, cut them in half and it performs okay. It's perfect for the ones we get at Costco. All in all, this microwave does the job, but I don't think I'd recommend it for someone who cooks a lot, because of it's size. But for a bachelor or bachelorette, it'd be perfect.

Carrots came out only in short slices and zucchinis became mangled stuck together, and I just couldn't get it to work like advertized. The blades look dull, and the Vegetti appears to be made from very cheap plastic; I don't know how long before this thing breaks. I guess you get what you pay for, but with what I know now I wouldn't even spend $10 on it.

Moving forward with my recent healthy lifestyle I decided I wanted to monitor my weight. After looking through reviews I decided this was the one I wanted. Although, I found out it is not what I was looking for.<br /><br />First off, I tested the scale by placing a specified weight on it and each time it would miss the actual weight by 2-4 pounds being either higher or lower...<br /><br />This was pretty frustrating because sometimes even the smallest drop in weight makes me happy and keeps me motivated. I wanted something that would be accurate every time I stepped on it. I dealt with this for a little while before doing serious research and getting a scale that I LOVE.<br /><br />I have owned it for over a month now and can say it is accurate every single time! I check it every so often with a weight to be sure and it has never been wrong.<br /><br />I actually ordered it here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1lKSlNc<br /><br />This thing is magnificent! I hope I could help others by sharing my experience.

I gave these goggles as a gift to my brother's kids. They are participating in the swimming team and they spend a lot of time training every day so I thought that this will be a great gift for them. They were very happy and after using them at the training sessions, they told me that these are the best goggles they ever got. They said that the goggles are perfect and the straps adjustment is very easy. They liked the blue color very much because it is their favorite color. As they are using them for some time now, they didn't broke and the quality didn't change. I liked the one year quality guarantee, it is a great offer but I didn't use it till now. The visibility is very good for outdoor usage while it is not as good when used indoor, and this is why I gave it 4 stars. Over all, they are well made where they protect the eyes perfectly. I highly recommend this great product. Thumbs Up

This speaker was supposed to just let us play some tunes while enjoying a day of fishing, but it performs even better than what I thought.

I'm constantly getting my ankles taped to play basketball, need to immobilize my ankles. It definitely beats the nasty white most athletes use that leaves a mess after you take it off. Since it's called Fidowrap, I'm guessing it's for dogs? It didn't really make a difference for me, but I did use the white tape to mummify my dog for halloween. Worked great, didn't come off.

I ended up putting the bass thing together multiple times: first i had used the wrong tension rods and didnt know until i got to assembling 1 of the Toms, then I had leftover washers and realized they should have been placed on those tension rods.

Also, Logitech stopped making their product. So I gave this transmitter a try. I am very pleased with the wireless range. I was a bit concerned given the small size of the transmitter unit. However, this set performed quite well in every scenario that I tried. I have located the receiver in all of my rooms and I am getting clean reception. What I like is that I can get addition receivers to place in multiple rooms. I don't know how many transmitters can be used at the same time but apparently they use a smart pairing feature that allows several transmitters to run within the same home. I don't really need the iPod cradle but this is a nice extra feature.

909	__label1__	2	N	Books	0061995045	The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic	Better, But Not Excellent	Interesting book. It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality.

927	__label1__	3	N	Beauty	B00CP4H3T0	Philips Norelco PT724/41 Shaver 3100 (Packaging May Vary)	decent for price but you get what you pay for	If you can afford a better one I would recommend doing it. I can go into a long review but I don't see the need, you get what you pay for. This razor feels cheap. The heads are not very flexible and the groomer is not very sturdy.  It's a pain to clean and it cannot get wet. I have bought many electric razors and I can tell you that this will get the job done but like I said before, get a better one if you can afford it.

Some reviews suggested taking it with food and water, so I did. I can't give a fair comment on weight loss effects because I feel  I wasn't on it long enough. Though I didn't lose a pound,  I moderately exercise everyday. Don't feel it really suppressed my appetite either. I gave product 3 stars because it may work for someone else. If you are sensitive to caffeine, then I suggest you don't try it.

That was okay because it normally lasts for a while, but even before he wore it the first time the nose was already cracking off. Pretty poor quality there. He doesn't care, he still loves it, but it's still kind of irritating. Also, the strings are really short. I know it's for boys, but it fit on both my head and my grandma's head, but the strings looked ridiculously short, even on my little brother (who is 7).

I've had it for 3 years and the battery is still great. I even use this for gaming and it still runs smoothly. I had problems with it when I first bought it. The charging circuit wouldn't work and they had to replace it. But after that, it ran smoothly. The laptop can run Adobe Photoshop CS5 but lags a little. It's good enough for a student like me. 3 years ago, laptops were pricey and this fit my budget.<br /><br />My Cons:<br />It's too damn heavy if you want to bring it anywhere. My back hurts a lot after carrying it the whole day. It heats up really fast if you're gaming or programming. I actually got burns before when it got too hot and it was seated in my lap. The touchpad is annoying too, sometimes it moves itself even if I'm not even near it, but it happens rarely.

The only thing I wish it had was a cup holder but we bought this for our second vehicle so we probably wouldn't use that much anyways.

If you can catch it before it spills over completely, you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty, pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving.

This was a new look for me at Chinese heritage. As a daughter from a wealthy Chinese family, she gives insight into the abuse that knows no economic boundary. She had a cruel Eurasian mother that added a whole new element to the traditional family. Adeline eventually moves from China to England and then to the US while trying to preserve her family ties back home. It was an interesting look at three cultures and how they affect our image of family. It was an interesting read but be prepared for a terribly abusive story.

I am trying to control my dog who hasn't learned obedience commands is exhausting and often nearly impossible. But teaching him simple commands from this book will make a world of difference and provide a great opportunity for bonding. So thankful for this book that is so much helpful. I have learned to keep in mind that puppies have short attention spans, and it is unreasonable to expect to have your puppy's full attention for a long period of time. Keep your sessions short at first to minimize distractions and maintain your dog's attention, gradually increasing the amount of time spent on training each day.

I expected something like 50 pounds in a couple of months and instead I only lost 28 pounds in two months. I know that is still A LOT.<br /><br />On the other hand I never lost so much weight before as I did by taking this supplement. I didn't have a single side effect. No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either. Some other pills I took caused me that a lot.<br /><br />So, this is actually a great product, I'm just an impatient guy. It took me years to get this fat and I want to get rid of it in months. I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products.<br /><br />I think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often.<br /><br />If people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it. So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health.

I wanted an integrated solution to stream music from my iPhone to a pair of floor-standing speakers wirelessly. My speakers do not have wireless and I did not like having a separate wireless receiver and amplifier. Since my phone supports Bluetooth I gave this amp a try.<br /><br />It worked as long as the distance between my phone and speakers was within 20 feet before cutting out. The build quality seems a bit cheap but for the price I guess that is what you get.<br /><br />The real bummer however was the fact that there is a constant hiss in the audio. I think this hiss is generated by the amplifier itself. If I turn down the volume the hiss goes down. If I turn it up the hiss comes back. This is very annoying since I otherwise would have liked this product. Unfortunately this constant white noise is driving me crazy. I have since returned this unit and purchased a similar product from another vendor.

It has ample power and is convenient to carry around. I charge my iPhone and office phone (HTC Thunderbolt) with this and I can probably get at least a full charge for both phones from it. I have tried it on separate occasions and so far, I have not been able to get even 4000 mAh from it. Not a big deal for me because a full charge for each phone is all I need when traveling. But if you are counting on the full capacity as advertised, know that it is really more like 4k or so (roughly). Still pretty good given the compact size in my opinion.

Even though this book has some very important lessons to teach us, I still think there were so many things missing out in it. I really like how the author relates us humans with animals, but there could have been so much more than merely just relating the two species and giving a few examples.<br /><br />I love Natura and tend to follow it all the lessons it I learn from it. It is filled with if not millions but thousands of new ways to inspire and motivate the humans, however this book lacked that spark you expect when talking about nature. So for me, its below than what I had expected. Hence the 2 stars. Thank you

Though I do think that the book could have done without certain unnecessary events particularly towards the second half, felt the story was being dragged in certain parts. Perhaps I am being overly critical. Overall it's well written and an enjoyable read.

1145	__label1__	2	N	Baby	B000MAER3Y	Chicco Keyfit 30 Infant Car Seat and Base, Adventure (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	MONSTER car seat!  Great statistics, horribly uncomfortable!!!	This carseat has great reviews in terms of how safe it is.  A look at the reports and stats involved with testing this carseat are impressive.  What they forgot in designing this carseat, however, is comfort (both for the Mom and the Baby).  My baby HATES sitting in this carseat.  It's super-narrow and deep.  Maybe the depth is what makes it so safe but I wonder if it's worth it to have your baby be uncomfortable each and every time you take a car ride. In terms of discomfort for the Mom: this car seat is heavy and bulky.  I hurt my back hauling it with a three week old so I would suggest really thinking about how much you might be moving the car seat around (I live in NYC and I take the car seat out to use in its frame as a stroller--or I used to until I decided to get rid of this monster).<br /><br />I got this car seat off of my registry and was really thankful for it but this thing is a beast!<br /><br />My husband and I recently purchased a comparatively cheap Graco carseat to use at his parents' home and my baby LOVES it.  He can flex this little legs and he slept, well, like a baby in it.

But they are not even jumbo at all. They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos. So several look like they have had an operation, and split entirely apart and melted back together. But, what do you expect from anything now days that has 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. Overall, I'll rate these 3 stars, and lucky they get that. Would not recommend to toddlers, but only kids 5 and up, and expect them to cry when they get 4 exact duplicate dinosaurs.

If you have read his earlier works than you know how he writes and how he sets things up. He has a particularly dry sense of humor. Some things he says makes you go Huh? Then you realize he made a joke. If you have read Lucado before you know what I am talking about. I love the way he explains things. He makes you understand through stories and never feels like he is preaching to you. Its like having a conversation with a friend.<br /><br />"God's grace--His unconditionally loving, unmerited favor--is sometimes difficult for people to grasp, even though each one of us is in desperate need of it. But in Max Lucado's new book, GRACE, it is completely embraceable and understandable. Through Lucado's characteristic narrative style and profound biblical understanding, we learn that God's grace is truly much more than we deserve and greater than we imagine. " --Dr. Charles F. Stanley<br /><br />Final Thoughts<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that helps you understand grace through Christ, you like Max Lucado or enjoy Christian Fiction then try out this book.

The color is way off; it says Gold but is a light cream color. The rug is thin and will not lie flat because the &#34;shag&#34; is to thin and not heavy enough to lay flat so the creases in it remain from where it was rolled up. You can see the backing becausethere is not enough weave in the rug.

It has almost no moving parts and should be a a lot simpler than this BUT nothing worked. I saw it actually work for 30 secs before it stopped working. Very disappointed in it as the reviews from otters were great. Documentation is awful. Try another pool cleaner and skip this one.

1252	__label1__	4	N	Books	B0078XCPEG	Texas Hold'em Poker Flash Cards: HAND ODDS	My girlfriend swears by them (says this is why she won).	She had beginners luck in my opinion, but she swears that she won because of what she learned from poker flash cards. To be honest though, she does have the Hold'em 101 deck and the Hand Odds deck. I have browsed through them, they do have great simple question/answer format and everything seemed very easy to comprehend. If she gets the other deck, Pot Odds, I'll probably see if it will help my game.
1253	__label1__	3	N	Furniture	B00B9JIGOS	Sleep Innovations Shea 10-inch Memory Foam Mattress,  Queen	One Great Mattress	This is one great mattress. The only problem is that there is an odor emitting from the mattress. It has been over 2 weeks and it still smells. If there was no smell, it would be a 5 star rating. Do not know if this is normal or not. Will call if the odor continues.

It was great for him to just roll the seat while holding my son's hand. There was also room inside to put the diaper bag so his arms and shoulders were free too!

It will be used over and over again!

Whether you are making a stir fry, soup or stew, or you simply want additional flavor in your gravy you will really enjoy the authentic roasted flavor of this product.

1263	__label1__	1	N	Wireless	B00CTGDSQQ	Huawei Ascend Plus H881C STHUH881CPWP Prepaid Smartphone Straight Talk	Extremely laggy and glitchy	This was my first touchscreen phone; I got it because it was a good price, but I really regret buying it. At first it was okay, but I've had it for about 9 months now, and I get extremely frustrated with it.<br /><br />The lag is HORRIBLE. If I try to call someone, it usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3-4 minutes to actually place the call. It gets really frustrating. I'll press the call button and wait a few minutes before it actually calls. A lot of the time I'll receive a call from the person while I'm trying to call them because they're tired of waiting for the call to go through. Then I'm dialing them and they're calling me at the same time, and hanging up ends both the calls and we have to start over. It's pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />The apps freeze and crash a lot - and not just downloaded apps, ALL of the apps on the phone. If I go to my contacts and try to call someone, the app freezes and says it has to close and I have to reopen it. This happens a lot with messaging, too. I'll try to click on a message and the app freezes and force closes. Also, there's a weird glitch where I open a message and try to type, and it won't let me. I have to tap on the message box over and over again, sometimes for a couple of minutes, before it finally lets me type. If I type a word, it shows that I'm trying to type it and then deletes each letter as I type it.<br /><br />The memory is pretty bad. I was going to just get an SD card and use it to store apps and stuff so I could have more on the phone, but most of the apps won't even go on the SD card and have to be stored on the phone, so there's really no point. I have barely anything on my phone (maybe 5 apps and 150-200 pictures), and the memory is full.<br /><br />Another weird glitch I've been having is when I press the unlock button, nothing happens, and I have to press it about ten times before it actually responds and lets me unlock the phone.<br /><br />Overall a really crappy phone - I do NOT recommend getting it. It looks good at first, but the lag and horrible memory make it a very bad choice. If I had the money to get a new one, I would in a heartbeat so I wouldn't have to deal with this piece of crap anymore. I want to throw it at a wall every time I try to use it.

This one works fairly quick but does best when your engine is running. I find that especially irritating if I am checking all four tires. A big waste of gasoline. Still I'm satisfied with the product. A very good portable compressor. I like the way the connections are made which are of excellent quality. The price is reasonable

Everything is pre-installed, you don't have to do anything except connect to your screen and power supply. Of course, there are optional applications that came with a disc. Activation code is labeled on the computer. Everything works out fine. All the driver updates and applications that are necessary for your hard drive took about 10% of storage, something that I found some people do complain about. But nothing useless is found, unlike majority of pc on the market. Now as for gaming. It does allow you to run majority of games that are available. However, keep that in mind, lots of games have low requirements, so this hardware works just fine. I use mmohut as reference, but a lot game review sites have similar rating on games. For their top rate games, this computer is nothing to brag about. Many popular games have way too high requirement that is just out of this computer's league. It does allow me to play certain game like Soul of Ultimate Nation at high setting very smooth. For a casual gamer, less intensive applications, and for $500, this computer is truly a steal. But if you want to run heavy intensive games like WoW, Terra, and so on; you can settle for low setting or do some serious upgrades. My new parts are arriving soon, so I will update as soon as I can.<br /><br />Update: I bought AMD Radeon HD 7850 ($210) to replace the graphic card that came with the machine. Now this is truly a gaming computer. Everything is above 7.0 in Windows Index except hard drive. The new graphic card makes the machine runs extremely quiet, unlike before which felt a trunk driving by every single time it is turned on. Although I did upgrade the memory ram to 16GB, which I don't think it's really necessary for everyone. My advice to everyone that want to play some of the popular game today, upgrade to a better graphic card. Another thing I notice is that my computer's motherboard is GA-78LMT-S2, while current product description is ASRock 960GM-GS3 FX. They probably changed to the newer one.<br /><br />My rating still remains. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do want to run the games I like in medium to high settings smoothly. This is also my first time to purchase a built PC and have upgrade it myself. I'm ok with what it is, and can be upgraded quite easily.

It just works effectively and nicely, but what I really like more about it is its ability to be flexed. It's so soft and can be used as a squeezer too!

Its light as green teas tend to be but the jasmine gives it a soothing aroma and interesting taste.  The only thing is that it does have an odd taste I can't put my finger on. Not that it's bad, it's not at all, just leaves you wondering, "What is that flavor?" It's interesting to say the least.  Otherwise, this is an extremely relaxing tea as most Jasmines tend to be.<br /><br />I would have preferred a smaller size to start with but this was the only option, at least on amazon.  I also ordered a higher grade version of jasmine at the same time; [[ASIN:B00HFMON0Y Organic Jasmine Pearls Loose Leaf Green Tea 4 oz. + FREE Blueberry Pomegranate White Tea 2 oz]]  Hhmm, that free blueberry pom was not offered to me in my last order.  Anyway, I steeped this tea for 5 minutes and was just amazed by its fragrance.  I love the amazing floral note from this jasmine, no foreign taste in this one that I cannot put my finger on.  If you can afford it, always go with high grade leaves.

Instead I found someone who is boring, just like my teacher. Maybe he makes good points, or different points than my teacher.<br /><br />But he's still boring. I hope this is not unfair. I'm sure it's a great book if you like boring things. I don't.

For example, the author Michael Matthews tells me how to make PEANUT BUTTER AND OATMEAL, do I really need to be taught how to mix peanut butter and oatmeal in a bowl? Put it in a microwave and eat it for breakfast? Unless I'm missing a brain cell, I think it's appalling to call this simple breakfast a recipe!! And very unhealthy to suggest I use a microwave to cook most of the meals!! Also there's lots of typing errors all over the place, as if it's been hastily copied and pasted. I had expected a lot more after reading all the positive reviews but I'm very disappointed, it seems you can't always trust what you see, if it looks too good to be true most of the time it isn't true.

1314	__label1__	2	Y	Wireless	B00PYW5X1A	Sentey LS-4560 B-trek H9 Bluetooth Wireless Foldable Headphones with Carrying Case	Great but not so great after all...	These bluetooth headphones really made my day.When i first saw them,i definitely decided to try it on and test them out.The sound quality is just sooooooo awesome and so clear.I can hear anything when wearing these headphones! The bluetooth function is great and I haven't had a problem with it at all.Easy to understand guides and a high quality headphones which can be a great gift for anyone.I also tried these headphones on my Iphone and the sound quality was great there as well.Steady bluetooth connection and a great look.Definitely one of the best headphones I've ever had!There was a slight problem with charging but i hope it's fixed now.  ***UPDATE*** So after enjoying the sound quality for a couple of weeks I decided to take it on a trip... I packed it in the case it came with and after coming back home and unfolding the headsets the headpiece on the left just detached itself... Turns out this product is really flimsy so to be honest I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere... Seller tried to help but it was just a cold response with no viable solution. It was fun but it was short lived. Here are the pictures to determine what happened only after UNFOLDING this... Pathetic material
1315	__label1__	4	N	Books	0373103484	Savage Love (Harlequin Presents, #348)	They Hate Each Other. Not!	Kim Sheridan has taken some time off from her school teaching job in a poor part of London to help her cousin out at the hotel she and her husband run, because her husband is in hospital. On the way she gets in a fender bender with non other than her ex-husband, Luke Savage, who, by coincidence, is staying at the hotel. They lapse into argument, because these are two people who truly seem to dislike each other. In fact, if two people never should have been married, well these are them.<br /><br />At the hotel, Kim discovers Luke is a writer, you think she would have known this, and that he is hiding out here to work. Then Kim's cousin is required at the hospital to be at her husband's bedside for a few days and now Kim is running the hotel by herself. She doesn't anticipate any problem, after all, there aren't too many guests. Then two of the staff come down with food poisoning and now she's in trouble. Then the ex she can't stand offers to pitch in and help and for a few pages there we think maybe he's not such a bad guy. Then more guests, friends of Luke's, show up and the books really takes off.<br /><br />I'll admit that at first I didn't think I was going to like this book. Luke is one of those self-assured, kiss 'em and they swoon kind of men that some romance writers like to write about, but that I don't like to read about, but he has character and lots of good qualities and that pulled the book up a lot in my estimation. A very nice and enjoyable read.

I got it from the Supercuts promo for free, and my barber said it would work on my thinning hair. Well it did actually work, but it took over 6 months for me to see results! You're better off chopping off all your hair, unless you have a ton of patience. Also a negative is how high the price is for this product. At the mall they're selling it for over $70 PER BOTTLE. This is just far too high. The sales lady was nice enough, very attractive and convincing in trying to buy it but I'm not going to give up $70 just because she smiles at me. Anyway, that's my 2 cents.

1368	__label1__	1	N	Grocery	B00O41OKEI	ONE ORGANIC Matcha Green Tea Powder (250g) - USDA Certified Organic	One star - I am worried about lead contamination in matcha from China.	Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China! I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.<br />I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a "Product of China. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.<br /><br />It is useful to read "SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online. They are a real eye-opener!

I had a lot of fun using it but it was bulky and hard to hold.  Maybe I have tiny hands.  My son wanted to use this so I let him try.  He's 11 and he really wasn't able to do much with it since he had to hold it with two hands but he had fun trying which is what is most important.  I wish this was rechargable so there wasn't a cord.  I did make some fun little things and after about 20 minutes I got the hang of it and it made it easier.  I will be buying more plastic for it because I do like it a lot and think that with some practice I will be able to make some pretty cool things.  There are just some design issues I wish could be addressed which is why I gave it three stars.

No chemicals that can harm me or my pet. Scares me every time it zaps but works well. The only thing is that the plug is weird and the gadget needs to be supported while charging. Charge last a long time and the fact that is re-chargeable is way better that batteries.

There is a LOT of storage in it. It will take several HOURS to put together and you need 2 people for some of it. Some of the material is less than stellar but for the price I was not expecting high quality wood. Only appropriate for older kids or teens. An adult would not appreciate having to climb into it at night.

The fact that it was so cheap, so big, and had non skid backing, we were sold. When it got here it was so much better in person! Beautiful, beautiful, it does feel a little cheap, but we don't care about that. After all it just goes under the dining room table to save our new floors. It's so perfect. 100%%% in love.

Yes, I suppose the palm oil is natural, but it's a saturated fat and it's NOT healthy. It also has added sugar. Other brands might be a better choice for health conscious consumers as it has only two ingredients, peanuts and salt.

I got another of the trigger kits to set up a third flash to get some extra light when I have a bigger photo-shot. Light stands were fairly heavy duty and I should be able to use them with my other mono lights. The triggers worked almost every time. I didn't use any sync cords, just mounted the transmitter on my camera and was all set to go. Took me less than 15 minutes to get everything out of the box, setup and start taking pictures.

Machined aluminum housing with 1.9mm durable tip.	very disappointed !  Had to return it	I guess I should have read the negative reviews more carefully because this stylus results you get from this stylus are pretty poor for the high price they charge.<br /><br />The pen has several faults starting with where the power button is located. I had to constantly try and rotate the pen so I wouldn't hit the power button.  Very annoying<br /><br />Next the so called worlds best stylus couldn't even capture my signature any better than my cheap 5 dollar griffin stylus.<br /><br />I honestly feel like I was ripped off<br /><br />Ok so then I gave the stylus to my friend who is a professional graphic artist to test it and see if it was just me that was having issues.  After 10 minutes of use she told me this was not worth the money I spent and directed me to buy something different.<br /><br />I can say that this stylus does NOT take notes very well and you spend more time trying to correct the poor results than just trumping a note or using a cheapie stylus<br /><br />I've decided that my 5 dollar griffin will do better than this 70 dollar toy<br /><br />My search continues for a good active stylus<br /><br />Trust me and avoid this at all costs

I didn't had any problems with this router, since I read all the positive reviews and decided to buy one for my newly purchased laptop. The problem started after my second firmware update. In the beginning everything was normal but after the update, router would constantly lose signal. Now, every 2 minutes my wifi disconnects for no apparent reason - and this didn't happened before, so I called support but they told me to reset the router, which I did, but problem continued. Luckily, I had a warranty so I returned the router.<br /><br />On my friend's recommendation, and he works at local internet service provider, I bought AC1759 Router ( http://amzn.to/13FE6I1 ), which didn't had any problem. I updated the last firmware and I didn't noticed a big change, so as long as it's working normally, I'm glad :).

But the worst thing happened when I tried to play it. The sound was awful, and the strings were too stretched - definitely not my recommendation :/.    My friend, who's a violin player in orchestra, bought a Cecilio violin ( http://amzn.to/1xAJ6IL ), a week ago from Amazon and it was far more better than this one, Sound is better, and the craftsmanship is perfect, I just ordered the same :).

As soon as I put it on my head and try to rub it in, my hair becomes a ratty mess!!  I don't know if it's because my hair is color treated, but this is unbelievable.  There should be a warning.  I spent 45 minutes brushing the rats out of my hair and had a very sore head for almost 2 days.  I don't know if these people bottled the stuff incorrectly, if hair wash means it's not shampoo and I am not supposed to rub my head or what, but I will NEVER buy this stuff and I will RUN from any hotel that offers it!!

I bought these pail refill bags to go with my pail and I am really happy with them.  I bought the system before I had my baby boy, a couple of months ago, and I am not unhappy with either the pail or these bags.<br /><br />At the moment, my baby's diapers are very small and therefore, the bags do hold 25 diapers, quite easily.  However, I should imagine that as his diapers get bigger, the bags will hold less of them.  At the moment, it is a bit of a squeeze to get the bags out of the pail, but they never break.  They snap shut really easily and firmly, ensuring any smells are kept inside - which is ALWAYS a good thing with diapers.  I am very satisfied with these.

I would say if you are about 5'3&#34; it would work for you. Look at the measurements before making a purchase. I set it up after the 30 days so I had to make use of it.

The arm rest are pretty smooth too.  The chair itself is soft and pretty thick so it must be of a high quality.

1434	__label1__	1	N	Home Improvement	B00BSN8DN4	Philips 431643 Hue White and Color Starter Kit (Old Model, 1st Generation)	not completely wireless and too hot to touch...	The biggest problem was, once I received lighting bulb pack, the thing that to remove a single bulb, you must remove all bulbs by resetting the hue bridge to factory default & building the system from the ground up. I had to call a repairman to do this, and when he saw what I bought he laughed at me. He wondered how I got Ethernet cable and in here it said wireless, so I had to put on other wall plug, which was hard, due to &#34;modern&#34; look of my house. Android app is also not helpful, it updates every hour or so and it really ruins the whole process, because I cannot stand by my mobile every time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, my friend who was lightning designer, said that I needed to buy a Phillips 2599 ( http://amzn.to/1wBs8pI ), because its completely wireless and it's easier to install it, he also bought a pack of them, a month ago and said he'll order more because of their quality.

1447	__label1__	1	Y	Wireless	B00A92V9QS	TuneBand for iPhone 5, Premium Sports Armband with Two Straps and Two Screen Protectors, BLACK	Decent concept, pathetic implementation	Pros: Concept of a case with an attachable strap to work as an armband. That's really about it.<br />Cons: Silicone material does not work well for work outs or running, except maybe very light workouts. It sticks to the arm with no flexibility to allow free movement of the arm. I usually run 3-4 miles followed by 25 minutes of strength training. This armband was painful to wear for more than a mile. When I removed it after the run, the skin is flaming red in that spot.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I think a more flexible material that doesn't cause so much friction would be better suited for this design. This material in itself is too painful to wear.

Let me tell you why. It fails in delivering the emotions that you could feel when reading the book. The characters in this movie are crafted after the nowadays heroes theme. And that's too commercial for my tastes. Indeed, the film delivers excelent entertainment and the effects are very realistic. It's a good movie, but the book is better.

Not on the X lifter but on the KEY itself....  the Snap-in part is made of such thin and brittle plastic you better hope you never have to take them off.<br /><br />The saving grace?<br /><br />If someone breaks with it and you are still in the warranty period Logitech will send you a new one.  Totally free!  They do not even ask for you to return the broken one.... Mainly because of what I saw when i disassembled it,  The membrane is unrepairable if opened up to clean circuit leads.

They were beautiful and dainty. The color is exactly what I was going for (although the color of the pearl on the earrings was different than on the necklace). The problem was these earrings were so flimsy that they started to bend upon opening the lever-back. Not good. I was afraid I might rip my earring hole trying to get these off.

Contacted Griffin direct, turned out to be a bad remote, wasn't transmitting signals, after a half hour on the phone, they said they would send another one, they did, pooped in on the iPod, and this time, it transmitted signals, now what signals it was transmitting I have no idea, it was so faulty and clumsy even my wife was laughing.

It looks great, for one, and is made with good, sturdy materials that are able to stand up to a lot of use. The zippers are especially nice, very high quality. I can carry it or wear it, and either way it's highly functional. Lots of space inside, too. It didn't smell great when I first got it, though, like a very strong kind of fake smell, but it dissipated after a few hours being out of the shipping material. Weird, but I didn't let it deter me.

I just needed something cool for my 6 year old to sit on while playing xbox or watching tv coz he always sat on the floor coz the couch was too far. All in all it works out fine, just wish they were made a little more tough.

This will not replace your surround sound system. The wattage rating and speaker size reinforces this point. That being said, the quality of the tower is up to par.<br /><br />* Quality enclosure<br />* No assembly required<br />* iPod mates to tower<br />* Remote mates to iPod<br />* Secure line Jacks<br />* MP3 Aux-in Jack<br />* FM radio with 20 preset<br />* Composite video output<br /><br />These are all good working features and those without functional glitches.<br /><br />An area that could be improved:<br /><br />AM stations seem to be non-existent. Perhaps FM stations are only received.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The tower is priced well and the quality of the audio is very good. We purchased the tower for our sons room and in that space the tower works well.

I often go out on to my front porch in bare feet and the first time I stepped on this mat, yikes! If you plan to be in bare feet I suggest another type of mat. Otherwise, very functional although not really attractive. I think I'll limit to the back porch!

It gets GPS signal (not very fast, but it gets...) and it does not have huge location errors. It looks good and the remote control is also very handy. Unfortunately, the maps updating process is almost impossible.
1515	__label1__	4	N	Toys	B00000DMFD	Mousetrap	I love this trap.	They do not require huge force to work perfectly. They don't splatter mouse guts all over the place or make a bloody mouse mess. Also, they don't really hurt if they release on your finger (hard to do since you're finger is never in the trap). They grab and suffocate the mouse. Awesome design, works terrific, an ant could set it off and it's practically impossible for mice to raid the bait without triggering the trap so even tiny mice get got.
1516	__label1__	4	N	Automotive	B002EOVDII	Car Charger for iPod iPhone 3G 3GS (White)	You DEFINITELY get what you pay for	This car charger is definitely on the cheap side. It feels very "plasticy" and is extremely light and unattractive..<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />It does work, at least it has worked so far for the last few weeks as I use it daily on my commute to work and back.<br /><br />I bought another, more expensive charger for my husband (he has an iPhone 4S) and it just seems more reliable, especially when plugging it in and pulling it out.<br /><br />Other reviewers have had some very bad experiences with this product so if you want to roll the dice and try your luck, give this charger a go. For a few bucks, even if it breaks, it's not the end of the world...<br /><br />My recommendation is to pay a little more and get a better quality Apple iPhone charger.

All-in-all it is a fun take on the old tale. (no new plot here, save for the in depth look at Tonto's past) Some Texas Rangers get ambushed and only one survives, leaving a Lone Ranger. A dead brother who's wife loved them both at one point, gives us a great damsel, add her impressionable son, a corrupt train mogul, a scary outlaw who eats parts of his victims, and a pair of hero's that carry the film with their antics, and you've got a good western romp. Depp plays a great Tonto, especially, the old Tonto that starts the flick.  My only negative is this: Two hours of  s - l - o - w  build up for thirty minutes of over the top climax is not that great of a ratio for a film. Thirty minutes of it could have been edited out and the thing would have been perfect.  4 stars, A "Must See" for fans of westerns, Depp, and The Lone Ranger. - MR

I purchased the product for my daughter 1 month ago and my daughter not pleased used the product. She tried using it again with a non-rubber pacifier. Same thing. Weird smell that caused my daughter to reject her pacifier. Save yourself the trouble and ruined pacifiers and buy another brand.<br />I would tell anyone purchase it. I always hate the product.

Unfortunately there is quite a lot of static on both speakers. The amount of static changes depending on where I position the speakers. I guess there are just too many gadgets out there these days that use this frequency band which makes it hard for these speakers to compete. I am going to have to get these exchanged for a model that is more robust.

1604	__label1__	3	N	Video DVD	B0013F2ESM	Sex And Death 101	Winona Ryder is in it and that has to Count for Something	I had high hopes for this movie. Winona Ryder's in it, after all. But those hopes were quickly dashed once I got into this corny and very stupid movie. Our hero, a rather studly guy played by Simon Baker, gets an e-mail with the names of all the girls he's been to bed with and all the ones he is going to bed. However, he's just about to tie the knot. Now if you were a stud would you get married, if you all of a sudden knew you were going to bed a gaggle of gals in the very near future?<br /><br />Winona plays Death Nell, a goth girl who goes around putting guys to sleep. She give them a potion and they go into a coma. Well, she inadvertently kills one. Naturally she's the last girl on the list and Mr. Stud doesn't want to go there, but can he help himself, can he quit taking good looking hotties to bed, even if he wants to? That is the question and that question is so silly that you might want to give this movie a pass. Still, it didn't suck, so if you're in the video store and can't decide what to get, Winona Ryder is in the movie and that has to account for something.

1637	__label1__	4	Y	Sports	B00B1N0R6C	Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro	My Ab Carver Pro Review	The Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro was the first piece of equipment I purchased when I decided to create a home gym.  Along with this, a jump rope, and a waist trimmer belt, I lost 70 pounds over the past 7 months.  If you are just starting out, I'd recommend it be the first piece of equipment you get as well because it allows you to focus on the most important part of the body, THE CORE, which you should focus on first especially when you are just getting started or back into a workout routine.<br />I am not what you would call a bargain shopper (more like an impulse buyer ha) because if I were, I would have realized that you can get this same brand, and same model at Walmart for 10 dollars less than what it is selling for on amazon which is currently $39.95.  The Ab-Carver Pro is available on the Walmart web site right now for $29.77, so with the added tax (how does Amazon get away with not charging tax btw), you'll still save a fist full of dollars.<br /><br />If that is still too steep for you, and I totally understand if it is - still a lot of money to spend on a couple pieces of plastic, the best priced ab wheel I found on here appears to be this one for only $7.00 - [[ASIN:B00J0F3DR8 Wacces Ab Power Wheel Ab Roller]].  So, that is a good price, a great price actually.  Now you are probably asking yourself if you can get an ab wheel for such a ridiculously low price and it will do the job, then why on earth would you spend almost six times that amount and get the Ab Carver Pro!?<br /><br />While I think it may be overpriced, there are TWO key features on the Ab Carver Pro which make me not regret the purchase.  I only regret not getting it at Walmart lol.<br /><br />Key Feature #1:  The Wheel size is very very wide.  This makes a huge difference especially in the beginning.  The wider wheel provides more stability and the increased stability gives room for a greater range of motion which means more muscles are being contracted during the movement.  This translates into getting and seeing results a lot quicker.  When I first started, I highly doubt I could have even completed one full rep on a classic ab wheel but on this I was able to do sets of 6-7 full reps from day one.<br /><br />TIP FOR BEGINNERS:  Start on a wall, no kidding.  Lean into the wall at about 45% angle and start with higher reps of 15 up to 30.  Once you can do three full sets of 30 reps take it to the mat (or the knee pads they provide which I don't use personally)!<br /><br />Key Feature #2:  The Contoured handles really help with different angles.  Thr great thing about not being in the gym is I'm not stuck in those ab machines which force you to move in one range of motion over and over again hitting the same muscle fibers the same way, every time.  The handles it easy to hit every angle of your ab and core by moving in slightly different directions with each repettiton. With the Ab Carver, you can literally move in 20 different angles and better still, it doesn't bother my wrists either (like typing this review does for example!).<br /><br />The only other two pieces of equipment I have used and still use in my "home gym" are, as I mentioned earlier, a jump rope and a waist trimmer belt.<br /><br />I went through a couple jump ropes before landing on this one;  [[ASIN:B00GGKPCPG Buy Jump Ropes Double Unders Jump Rope]].  My biggest tip here is to make sure you get one that is adjustable in length like this one.  If its too long you're not going to be able to pick up enough speed when you get good at it for it to be effective and if its too short, then your going to have painful welts on your forehead and on the top of your head for a while!<br /><br />I went through more than a couple waist trimmers belts unfortunately until I found the one I own now.  Many of these belts are, to be frank; crap.  They are thrown together without much effort and after you sweat in it a few times, it starts to fall apart.  I've been using the one I have now for the past 6 months, so as hard as it is to do, I think this particular belt actually changed my mind about ab trimming belts in general.  I always wear this during my cardio (i.e. running outside) and especially when I use the jump ropes.  I would not suggest wearing one while you are using the Ab Carver but for cardio and jumping rope this thing will make you sweat in the midsection and burn calories like no tomorrow.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KWIOF2Y TNT Waist Trimmer Ab Belt: Stomach Fat Burner & Toner &#x2605; Extra Wide to Cover Entire Midsection &#x2605; Uniquely Designed to Repel Sweat & Moisture w/ Anti-Slip Grid Technology &#x2605; No Slipping or Movement of Fabric! Premium Body Shaper, Slimm...]]<br /><br />I love the ab carver, adore my jump ropes, and I'm wearing my waist trimmer right now as I type this review (no kidding!)...but none of these tools would have done a darn thing to help me reach my weight loss goals if I didn't first lay the foundation with a set of healthy eating habits.  I hate the word diet, so I'll use "healthy eating habits".  These pieces of equipment I've mentioned will help, but if you want to really see those abs ya got to watch what eat.  And trust me I wish there was a way around this one because I love salty food but there is most certaintly not - Good luck friends!

As usual when you get something new, I was excited to use this TV in my living room. Although, that couldn't be further from what happened...<br /><br />When using one of the HDMI ports, the picture was very fuzzy and nothing seemed to fix that. Also, the picture quality was worse than the TV I was replacing from 5 years ago!<br /><br />This was so hard for me, after spending so much money and to be worse off than I was before.<br /><br />After I dealt with returning this TV and researching as much as possible I found a GREAT 50 inch TV that hasn't given me a single issue in any way.<br /><br />If you want to take a look, it is here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/1vi1LHp<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the TV for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one.

It shows why there is a need for a rebuttal. Morgan attacked by book with lies as I can show. Those who then wish to proceed to the full PDF will be welcome. My web site is at PROBITYPRESS.COM.<br />JOHN MORGAN: A FRAUDSTER EXPOSED<br />IF ANYONE WISHES TO ASK QUESTIONS, OR MAKE A STATEMENT, I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO RESPOND TO YOU ALL PERSONALLY.<br />I have written a book called The Princess Diana Conspiracy that has been attacked by a fraudster called John Morgan. Morgan has written a load of rubbish about my book and said there are two hundred errors in it and then expands that onto 500. One of Morgan's team of loyal "reviewers", Hiram, has arbitrarily increased that number to 600. It is all an exaggerated corruption.<br />This is a logical way for MI6 to progress their campaign. But they would also like you to read Morgan's rubbish because he espouses corrupt inquest evidence and so supports their purpose. If you fall for it, then Diana will become a fading footnote of history but the monarchy will also be safe for another number of years until it finally succumbs to the inevitable but too late for Diana's justice.<br />To all those souls that demand justice for Diana I ask you to consider the points I make. It will take a little of your time but Diana will benefit from your diligence and be closer to being avenged. You will follow my logic; most will recognize the truth having read this PDF.<br />I place you on my web, just before the PDF.<br />God bless<br />Alan<br /><br />JOHN MORGAN: AN UNPLEASANT BUT NECESSARY REBUTTAL<br />INTRODUCTION<br />An unpleasant task follows; one I cannot sidestep. Someone called John Morgan from Brisbane, Australia has compiled several books about Diana over the last few years taken directly from the Diana inquest transcripts. My book is sellingwell; his aren't selling. He has attacked my book with a criminal, so called, "review" that is false so I must put the record straight. Morgan's books are seriously flawed but I must also illustrate his purpose in writing his odious and corrupt little so called "review". Here is a free PDF download. I ask that you please make the ultimate judgement.<br />OVERVIEW<br />My book, the Princess Diana Conspiracy, has sold well and convinced many people about Diana being murdered; this hasn't pleased MI6. They tried to prevent my book from reaching the US market by sending my first book shipment back to the UK. Amazon.com was also later persuaded that my book was made of "hazardous materials"; this prevented it's availability around the time I was on four US TV shows and five US radio shows in September which was a critical time for my book's exposure. I also appeared on the Geraldo at Large show in New York and wasn't told I would be met by Imogen Lloyd Webber (MI6) who tried hard to debunk my views. Now MI6 recruit a failed author to assist them.<br />MI6 use Morgan's services because he is more concerned about money than justice for Diana. He has written several boring, disastrous books and has latched onto "The Princess Diana Conspiracy" to advertise them. He wrote his "review" based on his flawed opinions, not facts. Despite acknowledging that the inquests evidence is corrupt, he uses this same material to debunk my book and to write all of his own books; it is all he has. How anyone can write an account of what happened to Diana by using this same corrupt evidence and without challenging it, escapes me. MI6 had ten years to sanitize evidence and Morgan's views reflect the inquests findings, thus showing that he supports MI6.<br />I show that a huge number from Morgan's list of my supposed "errors" are either complete nonsense, his ignorance of the pre inquest evidence or his own baseless opinions. Morgan suggests his opinionsare indisputable and other "errors" are what he calls my "Power Constructs"; these are where he doesn't accept the evidence I present because he doesn't possess it. All are my supposed "errors" and a large number of examples are shown in the PDF. Morgan didn't start looking into the details about this vile crime until 2006. I began in 2003 so I use this pre inquest evidence to challenge the evidence that emerged from the inquest. Morgan perversely extolls the inquest evidence whilst also stating it is corrupt.<br />He attacks me by saying that "All investigative books-I include my own-have some errors. That is not the issue. The issue here is the level and type of error". So he pins the justification for his attack not on any errors but on the level and type of my supposed errors that apparently indicate I am working with MI6 (I am not). So, if you are content that the examples I show in the PDF illustrate Morgan's point is rubbish, and you may even regard his comments as pathetic, you will clearly see his purpose.<br />This was not a labour of love but done out of necessity. If we are to have justice and bring the truth to light then I need to clarify Morgan's purpose and send him to your mercy; not of my choice. Please find the time to read the full review on my web and take your own stance. Don't let this man pervert the course of justice now when my book takes us so close. Demand justice for Diana, Princess of Wales and deny MI6 their hard fought for victory.<br />PDF FOLLOWS ON WEB<br /> (I did make mistakes in The Princess Diana Conspiracy and have apologised. But these genuine errors were corrected and published as an eBook three weeks before Morgan's corruption emerged so his pathetic comments about my MI6 association and raising false flags etc., by deliberately giving out false information, are proven untruths; he knew I was pursuing justice. I had already corrected the genuine errors earlier so clearly wasn't trying to laya false trail. Please understand this point because it's the bedrock of Morgan's excuse for his corruption and proves this man is a criminal. I have now finished a review of my entire book and it is being typeset; it will be with the printers next week and also an update will be sent for the eBook. I shall also be extra careful when I send the files to the printers this time to ensure they arrive intact-more later.)

Every car has a car charger and every room in the house has an AC charger. As everyone knows, no matter what you do to try and conserve battery life on the iPhone, you inevitably run out of power. Ever since I got the QCell, that problem no longer exists. The QCell is small enough to just throw in your backpack, briefcase, purse, etc and know that you are covered. The charge time to get the phone back to a "worry-free" level is quite impressive. Those marathon conference calls that seem to occur when you are away from a power source used to be an issue. The long airline flights where you are playing a game on the iPhone, and even though you are in airplane mode, the battery still doesn't last. Well, with the QCell, both those problems is solved. The led comes in handy too when you are in a bind. The laser pointer is nice too, but I don't think I will ever use it. There are plenty of miniscule laser pointers out there, that are more comfortable and convenient to use.

I really dislike the plastic tops. In my opinion the plastic leeches into my hot drinks, giving it a nasty taste. Also the silicone around the cap leaves a nasty taste on the rim of the lid.The lid doesn't smell like anything to me when it's clean / prior to use and I've diligently scrubbed it, so I can only conclude that it's poor-quality plastic that's leaching something into my cup.
1686	__label1__	2	Y	Pet Products	B000WHUOEI	Ceva Feliway Plug-In Diffuser with Refill, 48 mL	Did not work for my cats	This really didn't do anything to help my cat's vomiting problem. I saw it works with some reviewers and some didn't. But with me seems like it didn't also. Since they are animals we I don't know how to ask them if did it works?
1687	__label1__	3	N	Outdoors	B005OHF65I	Intex Pull-out Sofa Inflatable Bed, Queen	seating is very stiff	The description and color was accurate, however the seating is very stiff. There is not a lot of padding and will require a thick pad to be tolerable to sleep on. We are putting it in our office and only using it as overflow when our guest room is full, so hopefully we are just using it for decoration. For the price I was expecting a little more.
1688	__label1__	3	N	Video DVD	B00HERGM86	Thor: The Dark World (2-Disc 3D Blu-ray + Blu-ray + Digital HD)	It is just ok.	I just watched this on Itunes and thought the film was just ok. I really enjoyed the first film. Sequels don't ever seem to be as good.
1689	__label1__	4	N	Toys	B000161RFA	WowWee Robosapien Humanoid Toy Robot with Remote Control	Not perfect but	This is pretty far from perfect considering that we really are not on the level where a robot will be completely interactive and reactive, but still, it's pretty good considering. I would recommend this to people who are looking for a decent little robot.

1692	__label1__	4	N	Watches	B00BS8UCAG	Casio Men's AE1200WHB-3BV 10 Year Battery Watch	I love it!	This is the most elegant watch ever. It looks so manly because it's very large and needs a large wrist to look appropriate. I love it!
1693	__label1__	2	Y	Grocery	B006N3I8FC	Twinings Earl Grey Decaf Tea, Keurig K-Cups, 24 Count	Taste funny	They have a very strange aftertaste. I dont normaly drink tea but these really taste funny. My wife says they are ok but I still have 1/2 the box sitting in my kitchen for over a year now.
1694	__label1__	3	N	Furniture	B0051HEDMI	Safavieh California Shag Collection SG151-1313 Beige Area Rug, 8 feet by 10 feet (8' x 10')	nice, soft rug	nice, soft rug. but the color is not ivory white (as pictured here), it's more of a yellow ivory color. and there's this really weird smell coming from the rug so I had to air it out a bit.
1695	__label1__	1	N	Books	0770437761	Unfair: The New Science of Criminal Injustice	Forensic Untrue Blue	The newest science is DNA the law enforcement community absolutely bows before it detectives do less work collecting and bagging samples in time for a long lunch judges admit the results into evidence locked and loaded, time for a power nap.  This book is a 1980s procedural of guesswork and judges in the a.m. issuing get out of jail cards not a chapter on DNA's infallibility - and yet it is not.  Justice Mark Dwyer of NYC in the beginning of this year threw out the results of two widely used DNA tests: low copy number and Forensic Statistical Tool he deemed them controversial.  DNA has been blindly accepted one judge took a stand his story, DNA's story now, that's a book, its a movement.  Christopher Roberts
1696	__label1__	3	N	Sports	B003P90K58	Tone Fitness 20-Pound Hourglass Shaped Dumbbell Set	Wanted it	Have been looking in places for this product. Saw it at someone's house and wanted it because it was a great way of keeping the weights and store of them when not in use. So was very happy to find it and was good quality to boot.
1697	__label1__	2	N	Kitchen	B000BQO932	RUBBERMAID Covered Pitcher 2.25 qt - White with Red Cover	Dissatisfied	The water smelled like plastic when stored in the fridge. Got disappointed with this, I love the quality of Rubbermaid but I did not expect that this will be the output of the pitcher.
1698	__label1__	4	N	Home Improvement	B000FONI5A	Lite Source LS-1673 Checks Polished Steel 60-watt Wall Sconce with Frost Glass Shade	Great work	I used this on a side wall in my kitchen. It gives perfect mood lighting. I used a CFL Bulb, which not only saves money and energy, but doesn't generate heat. I also bought this in the clearance section, and it was in perfect condition, so I saved a lot of money that way.
1699	__label1__	4	N	Pet Products	B000256606	Kaytee Timothy Hay, 24-Ounce	Great Stuff	I like this hay... It was fresh.. my rabbit happily had it.<br />I will recommend your products to all of my friends.<br /><br />Thanks for that.
1700	__label1__	1	N	PC	B009SJR2BE	Razer Kraken PRO Over Ear PC and Music Headset - Black	Disappointed, don't make the same mistake I did!!!	When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews. The price was great, but I should still expect to receive something worth actually using...<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, take a look at this one here on Amazon --------&#62; http://amzn.to/181sLOx<br /><br />I have never been happier with any other headset and hope you get the same result if you decide to try one!<br /><br />If not, at least I got to share my experience with this headset!
1701	__label1__	4	N	Outdoors	B005GHMT06	Earth Products Jamboree Military Style Folding Cot with Free Side Storage Bag System and Pillow (Green)	folding cot	This is perfect for any outdoor or indoor activities. Outdoor activities like camping, swimming, etc. Indoor is for unexpected guests who would like to sleep in your house because he/she is drunk. Anyway, it was easy to set up! I'll give this folding cot a rating of 4 stars because of the job well done.
1702	__label1__	4	N	Musical Instruments	B008SP3H0O	Portable Karaoke Machine	Good little Karaoke machine	I'm not a fan of Karaoke but my little niece is nine and thinks she's going to be the next Britney Spears. The little blue Karaoke machine is her favorite pastime. She's been using it since she was almost eight so it is super easy for a child or really anyone to use. The sound isn't bad either as long as you have someone decent on the microphone. It is a favorite for sleep overs and spontaneous moments with friends. If your child or little relatives love to show off and sing, this is a great buy. It keeps them entertained for hours.
1703	__label1__	1	N	Beauty	B00M6FJGJI	Cellulite Cream with Caffeine and 4% Retinol - Body Firming Cream Treatment to Reduce and Control Cellulite	used as directed and NO RESULTS!!!!! DO NOT waste your money on this product	Actually this is a fault product. Because I use it but I have no change. It give me just zero result. It is very very bad.
1704	__label1__	4	N	Office Products	B005GKAKF4	Bling Crystal Diamond Key Ring Chain Keyring Keychain White	Not recommended	This ring looks better in picture in person is so thin and diamonds too small looks beautiful but if you have a big fingers I don't recommended I have small fingers and I can barely notice I have it on :(
1705	__label1__	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B00004R9VW	Flowtron BK-40D Electronic Insect Killer, 1 Acre Coverage	Easy Kill	I don't have anything much to say but this is a very effective insect killer and good quality. Easy to use and safe, Protect your children from insect bites that can harm and cost irritation. Perfect for indoor and outdoor.
1706	__label1__	4	N	Watches	B00IK5YW0G	CASIO PROTREK triple sensor Ver.3 PRW-6000Y-1AJF	Heavy	Great looking watch but you better have a really big wrist to wear it. The watch is heavy and the band is stiff.

Was poor for use as you couldn't switch from one power to another. This is the first product I purchased from you that I wasn't happy with. This was not a good buy for the money. I usually shoot at a 200 yards and this doesn't works.
1708	__label1__	4	N	Sports	B000AMUFPS	Stamina Body Trac Glider 1050 Rowing Machine	POWER!	It is great, remarkably well built for the ridiculously low price I bought it for. Feel more powerful only after about a month of use. I had a screw come off after a couple weeks use but then again it is a small price to pay for how little this thing costs. I put the screw back on along with the nut and I was back in business. If you are looking for a beginner rowing machine, this is it.
1709	__label1__	4	N	Sports	B0000BYRT0	Penn Championship XD Tennis Balls (Single Can/3 Balls)	solid feel and good bounce	I didn't know there was much difference between tennis balls until I tried these Championship XD balls to fill out my shopping basket. These are considerably heavier than the cheapest ones. They're accurate in the wind and have a strong rebound, which is good for wall practice.<br /><br />The reason it didn't get five star is because the first ball cracked open after only about 3 hours of play. I'm not sure if playing in the rain had anything to do with it but it's the only tennis ball I've ever broke so far. The second ball is holding up well however, it's still very firm even after the letters have worn out.
1710	__label1__	3	N	Toys	0975277324	Ticket To Ride	Fine family fun	This is an incredibly fun game to play with friends and family. I know because I played it with friends and family. My kids always seem to win though and I always seem to be on the losing end.<br /><br />The game itself is beautifully designed, with the characters and the system being created to provide you with an excellent base to have your fun. You can also make sure to lose no pieces by simply placing them all in the box that has plenty of space.
1711	__label1__	4	N	Watches	B00IJ3PNF2	Technological Sense Binary Digital LED Waterproof Unisex Sports Wrist Watches Black	unique watch	This one is very unique, but only 4 stars as it is very difficult to figure out the time in the few seconds that it stays lite

The strings are loose and it would probably unravel if I hung it up, so now it's stored away.
1713	__label1__	3	N	Books	9881616409	Unsavory Elements: Stories of Foreigners on the Loose in China	Proceed with caution!	There are some lovely vignettes of expat family life in this compilation, most notable Susan Conley's exploration of hutong culture with her children, Alan Paul's lampoon-ish family adventure in Szechuan, Kay Bratt taking a disabled orphan under her wing, and Kaitlin Solimine's heart-warming homestay experience.<br /><br />But beware: this book lives up to its "Unsavory" title with several profane tales which left me shaken rather than stirred: not one but two stories about beatings (Hessler and Humes), an English teacher hitting on his female Chinese assistant (Matthew Muller), Nury Vittachi (a children's book writer for Scholastic no less!) interacting with gangsters and bar girls, Susie Gordon's glamorization of drug use and materialistic extravagance, SEVERAL baijiu (rice liquor) stories celebrating China's binge-drinking culture, and the editor Tom Carter's funny but nonetheless disturbing patronage of prozzies.<br /><br />Fortunately an anthology allows the reader to be selective, and there are a whopping 28 action-packed stories to choose from, so I still feel good about recommending this book to my network of expat families.
1714	__label1__	4	N	Apparel	B00HHOXREI	Orolay Women's Thickened Down Jacket Green M	Great Coat	This is a great coat for the value. I ordered this for my 86 year old mother for the style and because she gets very cold . When she put this on and wore it out last week it was a very cold windy day in Oklahoma and it kept her very warm.
1715	__label1__	4	N	Toys	B001LP4TZU	Jaques Playing Card - Plasticote Linen Feel	good one..	I brought these cards on wednesday and they arrived the next day. Great quality cards that dont peel at the edges when you shuffle like so many playing cards do. highly reccomended to all my best ones...!
1716	__label1__	4	Y	Office Products	B00SGQACIA	Premium Electric Mechanical Pencil Sharpener by Merite - Long Lasting, Heavy Duty and Light Weight - Battery / USB Powered - Includes Charging Cable & Extra Blades	it's so cool!	Works very well, I'm shocked by how fast it sharpeners. The design is different than what i'm use to but I believe it's more effective that way. The charger is a bit short, but a simple USB extender fixed that no problem. It has a low profile and fits nicely on my desk!
1717	__label1__	3	N	Books	1612182364	The Mongoliad (The Mongoliad Cycle)	terrible	This is terrible and not in a way that would have been subtle either. The blatant clashes of interested are so strong here that I wonder how the authors ever managed to agree on having it published. These people should get a grip.
1718	__label1__	3	N	Electronics	B00BN0N0LW	Sony MDRZX100 ZX Series Stereo Headphones (Blue)	Its of a Good value	Its of a Good value with a decent(not great) sound outcome. If you want ridiculously great metallic sound quality irrespective of its price. Its not worth it go for sennhieser or skull candy.
1719	__label1__	2	N	Kitchen	B001QTVT4A	OXO Good Grips Green Salad Spinner	Works, but flimsy.	THis works just fine, but I can't imagine owning this device past 2 years tops. The plasic green parts inside are so flimsy. Usually OXO performs with sturdy products but this one just lacks in every way. C'mon OXO, get it together. Your reputation has suffered in my household because of this crap.

1721	__label1__	4	N	Baby	B0052QYLUM	Infant Optics DXR-5 Portable Video Baby Monitor	You're lucky	I've had three baby monitors over the year, and this is by far the best. I've been using it now for a week and I can't believe how much I like it.
1722	__label1__	2	N	Beauty	B002TSA90C	Dove Men+Care Shower Tool, Dual Sided, Pack of 4	too rough and is actually painful	It feels like it is scratching or cutting my skin. It is way too rough and is actually painful. The tool is a nice concept because it keeps the puff from falling apart like some do, but it is so tightly secured in there, that there is no "give" to it and you just drag it all over your skin. I'm going to keep a regular puff in my shower, and only use the "loofa" side of this thing. I definitely won't be buying another one!

This monitor is not good!!!	I purchased this monitor last month. I saw the great price and decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this monitor had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality monitor for the price. Next, the DVI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a monitor that is just absolutely un-useable.<br /><br />Returning the monitor was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality computer monitor to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better monitor and have never been happier with it!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY monitor, check this one out here on Amazon -------&#62; http://amzn.to/1pfCBGU<br /><br />I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other monitors for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!

It is cheap and is a great item and I did not know that it was really this useful, i can laugh cause this was really unexpected that i purchased an item that i though was worthless but turns out to be something very useful.
1725	__label1__	1	N	Books	1476767289	Under the Dome: Part 2: A Novel	No Way	There is no way Steve King would be a part of this. I will not believe that. The publishers just decided to toy with customers in an attempt to get more money. Do not get this. If you truly support Stephen King, do not get this.

I have concerns about the paint and if it is toxic. My son is fine but I am very unhappy about this. I have a few other toys that have this coloring problem, and after reading about toxic dyes I am really concerned.

Either in Bluetooth mode or  using the audio jack, the buzzing noise is very loud. I'm very disappointed with this product. I should have save more and get a something better.
1731	__label1__	3	Y	Grocery	B00HFMHGV2	White Peony Loose Leaf Tea 4 oz. + FREE Sweet Coconut Creme 2 oz	Overpaid for this one	What can I say? I overpaid for this one. $25 was a little much, but I really wanted to try and see what these were all about. I must say that I was impressed, and hope that the price comes down. If under $20 this would be a great deal.
1732	__label1__	4	N	Grocery	B007R6VOZU	Milka Oreo Alpine Milk Chocolate, 3.5 oz Bar-Pack of 3	The supreme chocolate	I love the entire Milka chocolate line, but this one is the best. Its taste is so good and unique that makes me dream of it all day long. The only thing that stops me from eating it continuously is the health issues that I have.<br />My only complaint is that it comes only in this size. during my last trip to Europe I found this chocolate packed in a larger pack.
1733	__label1__	4	N	Camera	B00FAYL1YU	AmazonBasics 67-Inch Monopod	Won't be sorry	Love the monopod's range, rigidity, and flexibility. If 67 inches is not enough, nothing will suffice. It is one of those necessities that you really don't need to have in life, but because you're with a lot of people, taking front camera pictures becomes difficult. Other than that, this is a very versatile thing to have. If you have money to shell out, this is a good buy.

Had they read it they would have known it was a snooze fest.  I had more fun watching paint dry.  Most of what she said was simple common sense.  I already knew I was a visual learner, and I am not a huge a reader. To be honest after chapter 3 I gave up.  After week 3 no lessons refer to this book. I am glad they sent it to me free.

I can't believe that a welding machine can be so light and handy. It's so light and compact that I can even pack it in a suitcase,uses very less electricity. I mean just fix the plug anywhere and start working. Has the option of both gas and flux core gasless welding. Works really well and has made me efficient. It's extremely simple to operate.

1749	__label1__	2	N	Books	0425259854	Dark Witch (Cousins O'Dwyer)	Reused material	This is disappointing.  If you have read the Three Sisters trilogy you have read this book basically.  There is so much reused in this book from her other witch series that it was very disappointing.  It was okay to read it just annoyed me that it wasn't a fresh new book really.  I do not know if she has gotten complacent or what but a very disappointing book.

At first it was a little stiff, but he's gotten the hang of placing the light just where he wants it. It gives off good focused light and is easy to turn off and on.

Headphone quality is horrible and talking on the phone the callers had a hard time hearing me using the mic on these headphones. I ended up throwing all 3 pairs away.
1755	__label1__	4	N	Baby	B00KF2SCMQ	Kogno Car Window Shade for Baby, 2 Piece	Suction cups don't.  Product marred by substandard suction cups.	The way these are supposed to work is the suction cups grip the window and hold the shade up.  We tested both shades on window glass and the suction cups held for about 2 minutes before giving up.  These come with black suction cups.  We tried moistening the cups with water, they held about 10 seconds.  We tried the last resort, isopropyl alcohol and had similar results to water.  The whole idea is shot when the suction cups don't work.  The shade is well-made and folds up nicely.    Update on 1/27/2015:  Great Customer Service! The company informed me that I might have received an older pair of shades and will re-send a new pair to me.  I will update it after testing the new pair.    Update on 1/30/2015:  Sellers were very good to help us get a screen that works for us.  We now have a working screen and believe the suction cup problem is due to the suction cups being folded over in the package during shipping.  We're all set, thanks to the sellers help.

With the MS smooth mousewheel what happens is that as you go to click the middle button, the wheel spins slightly and this prevents the click from being registered correctly.

While I understand that I cannot fully review a product like this in this short amount of time there are some things that I already don't like about it which has me reconsidering this purchase in the first place.  First off all I ordered this via prime 2 day shipping. It took 4 days to arrive.  Strike one.  Secondly, the way this product is already making me feel from this short amount of time really worries me (i.e. irritable at work, easily flying off the handle at people, little things bug me more than usual, etc etc).  Strike two.  Now if these feelings of irritably and aggressiveness translate into a better workout in the gym and better overall gains, I might change my review, but for now other than some extra energy this product is causing me to be pissed off more than anything else
1762	__label1__	1	N	Home Entertainment	B00BB0ZTMM	LG Electronics 32LN530B 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LED TV (2013 Model)	Hard to believe my experience was so bad	Getting this TV for my bedroom, I figured it would work out just great even though it was such a good deal for just over $200...<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the stand and it's strength compared to the weight of the TV. I could hardly believe that it was able to support the TV for any length of time being so flimsy and wobbly.<br /><br />The picture was actually worse than the 5 year old TV I was replacing, I just couldn't believe that was even possible!<br /><br />The last thing that had me decide to try a different TV was the HDMI port having an issue where the picture was fuzzy and I had to jiggle the cord to get it to go normal, even with multiple cords.<br /><br />I ended up returning the TV and getting one I have never been happier with! It's been almost two months and I have yet to have an issue.<br /><br />I bought it here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qcVVnZ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the TV for you, at least you have a heads up about this one!

Mine is mounted over the bolt handle on it just clears the bolt and spent rounds, works fine there with no problems at all. I have a second on a 12 shotgun with no problems.

I still need to set 5-6 alarms every morning to wake up, so it isn't really enough to do the job for a really heavy sleeper.

I can wash the rice fast and efficiently using this bowl and it even drains the water quickly. I also like that you can actually squeeze it tight so that the water can get out on whatever you'd like to wash. I have tried veggies and fruits as well and I really like this tool, saves me time and energy. like to buy another one for my mom, she would love this.

Good customer service too. Bought these for my daughters party. Were simple to put together with little sticky tabs. Did the trick perfectly for the night. Hours of fun at my daughters party, really good value, got my dad to put onto cupboard to make it more stable so it worked really well.  Really fun props. Would recommend this. Great variety. Really sturdy props which I will be able to use again.

One hand towel unraveled on one side. All towels shed all over the washer and dryer, completely clogging the lint tray. These towels are good for rags around the house maybe.

Needless to say we hunted dark eggs in the dark.  They were very hard to break (had my thumbs hurting) and they were not very durable as one busted on my aunt.  You can only see a difference in the broke ones and the unbroken ones when you are in a completely dark room.  Very disappointed in this.  If I try this again I'll have to get bigger eggs and the bracelet glow sticks.

Not Worth It	While I thought these were going to be great, they ended up being less than what I wanted. The quality wasn't as durable and thick as I thought. Having to buy all of the bulbs was bad enough, let alone not being very sturdy. I would think twice about purchasing something like this. There are better options on the market.

1797	__label1__	4	N	Toys	B004P95ABG	LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 7965	Awesome model, but a bit flimsy once put together	I really, really want to give the Lego Falcon a five star rating. It is by far my favorite ship in all the Star Wars movies, and the Lego model is a near perfect representation of the ship. Also this was the first big Star Wars Lego set I bought, which in turn brought forth a wonderful second childhood of building the toys I dreamt of as a kid. I've since purchased six other models including the mighty Death Star.<br /><br />It really deserves the highest rating, but personal feelings aside, I can't. Why? Because once constructed, the model is very flimsy. I've read other reviews that bragged about how sturdy it was, and I don't see it. Every time I move it around, I have to be very careful. The side hedges snap out of place quite often and have to be reattached, and the ceiling panels can come off very easily. At one point, the entire cockpit assembly came apart and I had to dig out the instruction booklet to make sure it was properly attached. Honestly, I think this is a really awesome model, but it just doesn't seem sturdy enough for the rough play kids will do with it once built.<br /><br />Okay, now that I said that I can get on to the good stuff.<br /><br />This is really a fun ship to build, and it will take a while. I spent four afternoons working on it, but that's mostly because I like taking my time putting these things together. I suppose an expert builder with the time could put it together in one afternoon.<br /><br />Also, as with the Lego Death Star, which I also reviewed, the detail is amazing, and every single thing featured in the movies is here, from the holographic chess table to Luke's Jedi training ball (even though it`s on the opposite side of the ship). The Luke figure even has a reversible face with the blast shield so he can put on the helmet and train. The tiny details like that are the things that always amaze me about these Lego sets.<br /><br />The inside of the ship is very spacious. You could literally fit a small army of mini-figs inside. I can't help but think the Lego people could have done even more with the inside, but like I said, they already included everything you could think of.<br /><br />Also the mini-fig selection is awesome. You get all the main characters in their classic "New Hope" outfits. Though I find the inclusion of Darth Vader a bit odd since he never set foot on the Falcon. I would have liked to see Lando instead, since it was originally his ship and he later piloted it in Han's absence. They could have even put him in his generals outfit from ROTJ, but it's seems as if the Lego people wanted to stick to the characters from ANH.<br /><br />A couple minor complaints before I conclude. As other reviewers have noted, the cockpit is small. With all the room inside the main body of the ship, I think they could have done more here. Same with the gun turret seats in the center of the ship. It's really just a flat panel with some controls attached and can't be accessed from the interior of the ship. It seems more like an after thought.<br /><br />Overall, I hope no one lets my earlier criticism bother them too much. It really is an awesome ship, but I just find it a bit difficult to keep together, and I think that should be noted. In spite of a few flaws, it's still very much worth it.

This one is good too; yet not as superb as the first one. The plot is poorer and weak. Anyway can watch without getting board. First film was a unique one; i have never watched anything like it ever in my life. This one is more close to a massacre film. Extreme violence; but that is all.

It is so beautiful and comfortable. Yesterday, I and I only wear them today. This material is not difficult, do not sweat the neck, it's just perfect for fall and winter. I would recommend it to anyone, I ordered today. I got the black, it's true colors and lengths, so that you can see in the picture is you. I love I wear so many different wear fact, you can wear or fall. I love it!
1810	__label1__	3	N	Furniture	B00839JAXI	Simpli Home Cosmopolitan Faux Leather Rectangular Storage Ottoman Bench, Medium, Brown	Its ok	Its ok. When I went to assemble the legs, I found that two of the legs had a wide crack going down the entire side. Luckily, the cracks could face the inside and out of sight. Decided not to send it back- thinking that if the legs do split into two pieces, I can superglue them back together. The top seems to fit a little too tightly to use the tray side without making a huge effort to pull the two pieces apart. I don't think it was worth the money I paid for it, and actually saw it offered at a lower price later on another site.
1811	__label1__	3	N	Watches	B000VBL9BW	Michael Kors Women's MK5039 Ritz Horn Watch	it was too heavy	Just what I was looking for as far as color, material used and wrist size. The reason I returned it was because it was too heavy - really too much weight on my wrist and too large for blouse sleeves - they kept getting caught on it. I was sad that I had to return it.

1813	__label1__	4	N	Pet Products	B004MU1GLQ	Best Friend Mobility Dog Wheelchair Size Medium Dog	Good, but only 4- Stars	Ok, after a few bad products, now this is the third wheelchair I have purchased for Gracie, but finally a keeper... it is better than the first two for a few reasons. One thing is that it has a better balance than his k9 cart which the side bars on that cart bent after just a few weeks so I returned it. The other cart was from walkin wheels, it was expensive in price but cheap in design, it never worked well and broke only after a few days... We have been using this BFM cart for 2-months now and it's a good wheelchair, but I have to complain about the tread on the tires has already worn off a good bit. The company actually sent me two new tires for free, but I can only give 4-stars that the tread would wear down so quickly...

Now that it's more than a year, I get more and more disappointed with it.<br />A month after I bought the item, 2nd gen Galaxy Tabs were released with the same price. At first I didn't feel any regret but then my GT crashes so many times the longer it's in my hands. It keeps turning off for no reason. Sometimes I just compose text and out of nowhere it reboots. Sometimes I don't use it that much then the graphics get all wrecked (I really can't tell what happens exactly but the colors somewhat distort or something) It showed during the first few months I bought it but not too often and would usually go back to normal once I reboot but now it's really becoming annoying.<br />It's also bulky and heavy not like the new ones. I just gave away my GT to my brother after a year because it annoys me too much just looking at it.<br />I liked it when I bought it and thought I made a good investment but I regret having it. I gave it three stars because the specs overall is still good but it doesn't live up to how it should.

I still have some books to put on the lower shelves that I am a bit concerned about it holding the weight. I bought it because the price was right and it is for my home office. I didn't want to buy anything expensive for a room no one hardly sees. If you don't plan on placing all books or very heavy things, it should be fine.

I also wouldn't call the resolution anything special, I have smaller monitors that have looked better and are a few years older.<br /><br />I dealt with this performance for a little while but had to do something about it before I went crazy.<br /><br />I did some research and found a monitor that is SO much better and hasn't dropped a pixel in over two months, even though I don't expect it to ever.<br /><br />I bought it here on Amazon too ----------&#62; http://amzn.to/SHHmgn<br /><br />It is a great monitor and you won't regret using it.

But I was barely able to make it work, and even then I felt like it would fall apart easily. Luckily, my daughter knows how to care for her stuff, but this toy still feels pretty cheap for the value it provides.

As well as problems getting the computer to 'read' it to add songs. Then you have to convert songs into mp3 format to even transfer them onto the device for it to work.

It seems to be areasonable buy so far. The design appears appropriate for a new baby! A word of advice to new moms: avoid the bath tubs with the foam lining it as the foam mildews and is very difficult to keep clean!

This watch fits great. I love the small size, yet the numbers are very visible. I also love the material the band is made of. Many watches roll around my wrist, which is annoying. This watch stays in place and is very comfortable. I'm thinking of ordering a few more.

Some of the pieces don't go together as well as they should! Also you need an extra set of hands for connecting the headboard/footboard. But once it was fully put together I couldn't keep my little boy away from it!

I decided to wait a little longer to apply the glitter. Four hours later I came back to the same bottle of glitter paint and it was clogged and would only shoot paint a few droplets at a time. I had to hold the can three inches away from my project to get the paint on and I could only apply it in globs. What a waste of money. It doesn't matter if you read the instructions, which I did and followed. The tip/applicator is not right for the paint formula.

Even with plenty of water-based lube it was literally chocking me. The concept and small palm size is great, but they need to make a larger version. I just could not seem to get a comfortable tug from it. I love most of the Doc products, but this one was very tight. It ended up tearing after a few attempts.

The color is a deep charcoal, but not black. The material seems very durable and hasn't scratched at all yet (2 months). I was a little worried that the texture of the surface (which is about the texture of the inside of an iron skillet) might hold food particles, but that hasn't really been an issue.<br /><br />My only concern is that the guidance on cleaning from the swanstone company pretty much eliminates every cleaner on the market. No bleach and no ammonia? Almost everything has at least one of these. Without either of these, you are pretty much out of choices. That said, I have found a very successful cleaning ritual. I start with  warm water/dish soap/scrubbing sponge and finish with a wipe down with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and this seems to do a great job. I am a fan of bleach, so I do miss the sense of clean the burning odor of bleach gives, but don;t want to risk hazing up the finish.<br /><br />18 MONTH UPDATE. The finish on this sink remains flawless which I find very impressive. I have found a good cleaning routine as well. I use dish soap (e.g. Dawn) and a scrubbing sponge with very hot water most of the time. If it looks like ti needs a a little extra care, I follow that with a granite cleaner and polish. I go about 3 months between polishing and it still looks like the day I installed it.

I tried playing it with my husband though a few days after and we had a blast. It's a challenge just setting up the structures and the pleasure of ruining what he so painstakingly put up is a gameplay not available in the original game. That is why I'm giving it a four.

When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1oZcc2j<br /><br />I promise, they are well worth what they cost.

The only issue I have is that the retractable handle is a bit too short. I am not tall (5'7&#34;), and I have to bend over slightly to pull it along. If the handle were about 3 inches longer, it would have been perfect.

Now my iPad sits on my desk at the office, and pipes right into my little stereo there so my office is always filled with nice, easy listening music. I'd play Rock-n-roll, but office politics say "no harsh music". But the music I listen to are my favorite easy tunes, right off the iPad through this Dock.

1919	__label1__	3	Y	Video DVD	B000ELJ3JE	Beginning Pilates for Dancers - Get the Dancer's Body	Not Bad, Just Not For Me	It was okay. I was pleased to see that the video wasn't boring and the people on it didn't seem like robots like most exercise videos I have tried. The music was good as well. The DVD itself was very inspirational, I just think it's more than I am ready to commit to. So, I am taking points off for that. t contains 24 exercises that work on your shoulders, abs, obliques, legs, and glutes. I have no doubt that the program works, but it has to be something you're committed to. It's not something you can do for like 5 minutes a day and end up with a dancer's body. It's a satisfying, total body workout. A friend of mine used the system and she's looking amazing. I just don't have the discipline. So, if you're dedicated, then I'm sure you will look great. If it's a half-hearted attempt then there's probably another option.

A few months ago I had just gotten the PS4 and wanted a quality headset to go with it.<br /><br />My old headset was comfortable and worked well, I loved the bass you could hear with them but they weren't cutting it anymore.<br /><br />When I tried these I was definitely unhappy... The speakers would make an unbearable noise that sounded like rattling most of the time, even at lower volumes. If this wasn't bad enough, one speaker kept cutting out. I had to bang on the side to get it to start working again.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't enjoy these and can't imagine why they are charging so much for them.<br /><br />After this depressing experience I did some serious research and found a headset I absolutely LOVE.<br /><br />It's been over a month and I can't find anything to complain about. The sound and bass is great and I can wear them for hours on end without any discomfort.<br /><br />I got them on Amazon actually -------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1wbUoC2<br /><br />Even if they aren't the ones for you, I hope I could help share my story with this pair.

The idea is good but the finished product misses the mark. The rhinestones are stamped on, mine our on a curve. I paid over ten dollars for expedited shipping, it got held up.<br /><br />They graciously credited my account for shipping. They also credited me six dollars since the stones are not lined up straight. I guess i am supposed to be happy... I do not like buying merchandise that in time i may or may not like.

1938	__label1__	3	N	Watches	B000OUW0QS	Stuhrling Original Men's 148.33152 Classic Heritage Automatic Mother Of Pearl Date Watch	looks good	I own many watches and this one does not disappoint. The picture does not truly capture the beauty of this time piece. The weight is good and looks good on the wrist. The only downside is that it is nearly impossible to read the date.
1939	__label1__	4	Y	Jewelry	B00TGKBXF6	Demarkt Fashion Elegant Cute Lady Girls Blue Flower Crystal Ear Stud Earrings by Lemonc	Very nice	Because I have specific requirements earrings one pair of blue flowers. I think it looks a bit small, and when they arrived, but I have to say they were perfect for me, most importantly, I love them.
1940	__label1__	2	N	PC	B006OEL86Q	HP Folio 13-1020US 13.3-Inch Ultrabook (Steel Gray)	expensive laptop, cheap build	I was expecting very much from this laptop, having in mind the fact tat its price is not what you could call cheap. Unfortunately, it is build of cheap materials and it is very slow. From time to time I work with Photoshop. I am not a Power User, therefore I don't need a powerful workstation for this application. My old Dell was doing a very good job here. But this new HP Folio is a disaster: it takes forever to load the app and each operation I make in Photoshop is extremely slow.<br />Cannot recommend this product.

IU just hate to keep my phone on the charger for long because I really use it all the time. Having spare batteries was a must have for me and that is why I got this one here. I love it.

So far the canvas has stood up to the scratching from trying to make a nest. It didn't quite fit together so it is a little off balance.

The only problem there are some glue on the back.And if it had a storage battery  that would be best,so that we could have the fountain work  in the evenings.

1949	__label1__	4	Y	Tools	B00LSOZT58	My Mold Detective MMD105 Mold Test Kit, 5-Room Kit	Worked well and gave me peace of mind!	This product really worked and was surprisingly easy to use. After researching online, I discovered that MMD's method for testing was identical to the experts.. I was quoted about 5 times as much to have someone come to my house and conduct the same testing. The report I got back from My Mold Detective was very easy to understand, too. I sent off the samples to the lab and waited three days to get results which was shorter than the local IEP's turn around time that I was quoted... I guess a week or ten days is the norm... But, sending off the samples was explained on the packaging and I double checked on the website. I rate this product 4.5 stars
1950	__label1__	1	N	Home Improvement	B00PBS7YIW	SkyBell Wi-Fi Video Doorbell Version 2.0 Classic (SILVER)	CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PIECE OF "JUNK" IS STILL ON THE MARKET!	I can't believe this Piece of JUNK (cleaned up for publication) is STILL being sold.  I got one after seeing it at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas (Jan. 2014).  Thought it was a great idea until I tried to get it to work.  IT WOULDN'T.  I contacted their so-called customer service who promised to send me complete instructions.  I waited, and waited.  I contacted them again.  NOTHING.  I packed up the unit and found I couldn't return it BECAUSE...they took too long to get back to me and the 30-day return window had closed.  I took SKYBELL with me this year (Jan 2015) to CES to give it back to these people IN PERSON with a few well-chosen comments...and guess what??  They didn't appear at CES this year.  If you got this POJ to work, congrats.  For me, it's a $200 mistake.

I am retired but work out side as I see fit. The fit was great and I loved the comfort, until the toe got a hole worn in it just from kneeling in the garden and occasionally on the wooden floor on which I was working.

1953	__label1__	1	N	Grocery	B002DHUCEM	Special K Protein Shakes, Milk Chocolate, 4-Count Bottles (Pack of 6)	WARNING: Do not buy!!!! Waste of Money and a DOES NOT WORK!!!	I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased the Special K Shakes after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on the Special K Shakes and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.
1954	__label1__	2	N	Video DVD	B0071JADFU	Pirates of the Caribbean: Four-Movie Collection [Blu-ray]	Quality of packaging is low	I would have expected a bit higher quality in the packaging of this.  I don't really think this particular one is worth anything extra.  Not sure what they where thinking when producing this.  Note this doesn't refer to the movies themselves.
1955	__label1__	4	N	Toys	B000N5QNSK	Battat Take-A-Part Vehicle Airplane (Old Model)	airplane	The Design & Drill driver still struggles on bolts that have been tightened too snuggly, but these fasteners aren't "tight" in the adult sense of the world an some simple finger manipulation will easily break them free.
1956	__label1__	1	N	Camera	B0019CSVMW	Pelican 1510-004-110 Case with Padded Dividers, Black	padlocks protectors were broken...	I received a malfunctioned case :/. Once I got it, I saw that padlock protectors were broken together with padlocks - which is an utterly disappointing experience. To make things worst, the case was too small for my pelican even though in the description, it said that it could fit most of them.<br /><br />I returned the item and I bought a Pelican 1650 (http://amzn.to/13zGr7a) which is much safer and harder to lockpick. It had additional place for camera, so I was pretty satisfied.

It kinda sucks because i actually liked it. It sucks because you cant read any of the instructions or the box since its in jappanesse and i cant call and ask for a replacement or anything because the number on the site doesnt work. Kind of feel like i wasted 70$...
1959	__label1__	4	N	Electronics	B005Z3GINK	Ivation IVA-400 Waterproof Wireless Bluetooth Shower Speaker and Handsfree speakerphone for All Bluetooth Devices, BLACK	Delivers as promised	I really love this shower speaker. It was very easy to setup and link it to my Android HTC smartphone. IT sounds great in my  my bathroom and it has enough stamina to run for more than 1 day. However, the design is not as beautiful as it seems to be in the pictures which are posted here.

1961	__label1__	4	N	Baby	B0030EH8OO	Contours Lite Stroller, Tangerine (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Awesome!	I purchased this stroller to use for my granddaughter who is 14 months old. She seems to like it very much. There is a cup holder for her and one for me as well. There is plenty of room for storage on the bottom. It is pretty sturdy, and very easy to fold.
1962	__label1__	3	N	Lawn and Garden	B003TV4A7G	Best Selling Nassau Cast Aluminum Outdoor Bistro Furniture Set, Brown	Very shiny black and very scratched	I thought the color was texture coated gunmetal like the matching settee, coffee table and chairs with the same pattern and from the same manufacturer. They were not. The chairs and table were painted shiny black and very scratched.
1963	__label1__	3	N	Lawn and Garden	B007NXNNE2	Shine Company Backless Garden Bench, 5-Feet, White	beautiful bench	The bench arrived promptly, appears to be exactly as described and actually had a better appearance that the photo HOWEVER, the shipment only included the bench parts itself...no instructions and no hardware and so my husband being the handyman that he is decided to buy the hardware, and drill a few holes that were missing and voila! A great bench that looks wonderful on our porch.  I will recommend to friends but with reservations.
1964	__label1__	1	N	Kitchen	B005NIXSHQ	Hamilton Beach 51108 Stainless Single Serve Blender with Travel Lid	Power issues	Really bad quality. It lost power within a week of using it. I sent it back and got another and that one lost power about 6 months in. Very useless.
1965	__label1__	4	N	Luggage	B007UNSIH2	American Tourister Luggage Splash 21 Upright Suitcase, Black, 21 Inch	I've been using one of these for a year.	Light, tough and easy to roll.  It's held up well to the abuse of airline travel, it's crazy lightweight, and easy to roll and control on it's wheels.
1966	__label1__	1	N	Kitchen	B00130399K	Black & Decker TRO490W Toast-R-Oven Classic 4-Slice Countertop Oven, White	Look elsewhere	I will have to agree with the others, the quality on this unit isn't there.  I've had good luck with some other Black and Decker items but not this one.  Had the handle loose in the box, didn't even survive shipping...
1967	__label1__	4	N	Automotive	B002AKFA94	Emerson Auto LED Parking Signal	Thanks for the good service	I had one before but a friend talked me out of it so since I had given mine away when I saw this I knew I wanted it.  Do yourself a favor and part with just how many bucks to buy this. It's a brilliant very inexpensive tool you'll use every day and it makes life just that much simpler. Thanks for the good service.

I got it for my little brother for his birthday, and it was a big hit with him. It's pretty easy to operate and looks realistic - he had a blast showing it off to his friends and getting confused looks before he explained what it was. It takes good quality pictures, and you can get them on the computer by using the USB cable. I think it's pretty neat that you can record with it, too. Overall a pretty good spy pen for the price; makes a great gift and would even be fun to play around with yourself.
1970	__label1__	3	N	Baby	B002VK4CII	JJ Cole System Diaper Bag, Blue Vine (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	all plastic and cold	I was expecting something softer more like a cloth on one side and plastic on other, but its all plastic and cold, but I guess it works for the purpose of changing baby, just use a little blankly on top if changing in the cold commercial bathrooms or other areas. I love the case, its pretty handy, you can just load it with wipes and diapers and you don't need a separate case.
1971	__label1__	2	N	Baby	B003HKR0L2	Disney Baby Music and Lights Walker, Happily Ever After  (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	needs to be picked up set up with one hand	Although it is really adorable and my daughter likes it the manufacturer should have considered that this walker needs to be picked up set up with one hand. Pick it up and it opens to the highest level never try to lower it with the baby in it.
1972	__label1__	4	N	Sports	B0030EW7Q8	LifeSpan TR1200i Folding Treadmill	The tredmill it self is great	the only reason I gave just  a four star and not a five is the fact that I was disappointed with the way it folds it is a little heavy, and does not fold to a point I should beable to store it in a compact closet or beneath my bad. Other then that it is a good quality and multi featured machine.
1973	__label1__	1	N	Sports	B00O2M8OGO	Bundle: 6 Items - The Amazing WUBBLE BUBBLE Ball Bundle - Blue WITH PUMP & Orange, Purple, Red, Pink, Green with NO PUMP	WASTE OF MONEY	I am reviewing the Wubble ball on two levels:<br /><br />ONE, it's a piece of junk! I bought one at Target. I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles. &#34;Lifetime replacement warranty&#34; &#34;Do not return to the retailer.&#34; Only problem, they want $7 &#34;handling fee.&#34; BS! Plus the cost of postage to mail it back.<br /><br />TWO, As is typical, since these are only found in Target stores right now, you have a few scalpers on Amazon and eBay who buy up as many as they can at Target (causing them to sell-out quickly) and then they offer them at twice the price.<br /><br />Amazon really needs to put an end to this Third-Party rip-off activity on their website. It really degrades the whole shopping experience.
1974	__label1__	1	N	Sports	B00D9Q7ZVY	j/fit Deluxe Doorway Pull-Up Bar	Doesn't work	The screws that came with the product were awful. The first screws grooves got worn out whilst screwing them into the door frame. I tried to drill the second one in to prevent it wearing again and the head of the screw snapped clean off. Extremely dissatisfied! I can't use the pull up bar at all because both screws messed up
1975	__label1__	3	N	Shoes	B000TR7XMC	Tamarac by Slippers International Men's Cody Sheepskin Slipper,Rootbeer,11 M US	Not Satisfied	After only a few days my son showed me where the wool in the foot bed was wearing away, not just initial shedding, but to bare fabric below. I have considered sending them back. I thought the sole was wool like the lining, but now I'm not sure. There was a very strong chemical odor from them when I opened the box, but they no longer smell.

1977	__label1__	3	N	Pet Products	B000H72HD4	Petmate Pet Porter Fashion Kennel, For Pets 15 to 20 Pounds, Wheat/Coffee Grounds Brown	I don't like this any more	My cat is an adult size cat who is, per the vets opinion, not over weight and is healthy. I had to shove the poor thing in there. And though he is sweet, my cat doesn't like to be held or cuddled so a smaller crate was definitely a bad idea- he became so distraught he used the bathroom twice in it.

It was shattered upon delivery. I picked up the box and could hear it was broken inside then small shards started falling out of the box. I just threw it in the dumpster. I didn't want to track it in through my house or put it in my car to deal with return.
1979	__label1__	3	N	Lawn and Garden	B003AU5TSK	Brussel's Lucky Bamboo, Pyramid 1 Layer	reasonable price	I purchased a cute little bamboo plant, known to bring luck, for my daughter who was having lots of bad luck. Well, it took a few weeks after it arrived but her luck did improve. I know that the plant wasn't the real secret to the change in her luck - but who knows- It was a great gift at a reasonable price!

Very firm and solid in the hands. The grips could have been designed a little more comfortable, but these serve their purpose well and with Amazon prime saved me a trip to Home Depot. By the quality of build will seem like they will last a long time, recommended!

I did not expect this quality from a low cost TV. Sound is pretty good. When you set up the TV, go to &#34;Audio&#34; section and manually set the bass level to +8, and the treble to +3. This seems to be the best sound setting for this TV. Overall, I am very pleased with this TV.

Second it was supposed to be a rocker when my baby is a toddler... Laughable. She was too big for it at 6 months old and 16lbs.

I purchased this TV last month as a living room TV. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, one of the HDMI ports began to fail and caused the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for WAYYY CHEAPER!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 60 inch TV, check this one out -----> http://amzn.to/1ozWTLS<br /><br />It is here on Amazon and I currently own it now. I have never been HAPPIER!<br /><br />It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!

However, I would warn them that the liner has this giant stupid tag that you need to remove, but when you try to remove it, it will leave a big tear on the liner.

I have an iHome in my kitchen & one in my bedroom, and I didn't want to spend over $200 to replace them to charge & listen to my iPod when I upgraded to the newest iPod touch. This adapter will ONLY work if I remove the case I have to protect the iPod, and I didn't even go with a thick or heavy case.<br /><br />Get the 30 pin to 5 pin cable instead, unless you like keeping your iPod caseless.

The only thing that could make this better would be a better suction cup. It fell right off the tiles once the weight of the toys was added. I got a new suction cup at Walmart and did the vaseline trick. Now it is a joy to have.
2007	__label1__	2	N	Lawn and Garden	B000QJEW9K	Suncast Recycle Bin Kit  BH183PK	poorly designed	It takes up a lot more room in my apartment than I'm comfortable with. It's also poorly designed in that there's no place to attach a plastic bag to collect the recyclables you put inside of it. Also, when the crates are stacked on top of each other, it's sometimes too clumsy to put certain types of items into each crate's opening unless it's the crate at the top.

Unfortunately, I plan to buy a more durable and stronger battery for my highly expensive toys.

It did make them look like they were muddy (it looks like truck bedliner) and I would have prefered to use it past seven days after opening.  Other than that it was awesome.

2012	__label1__	1	N	Camera	B006P88VSE	Dropcam Wi-Fi Wireless Video Monitoring Camera	beware of a monthly recurring fee...	The cam was good, once I saw that it's the bestselling camera here, I bought it. However the problem with it was a recurring fee of $100 - $300 a month, which was used to pay hosting. The thing that you cannot download videos that you record without a subscription is disappointing and really not worth a price.<br /><br />My friend has a Samsung SmartCam ( http://amzn.to/1zrNtnA ) which was far more superior to this one. It didn't had such a problem and the thing that you can use videos to record anything you want for free is really something that's worth it.

Upon using it, it's not as friendly as the other branded phones. For us, windows 8 is hard to use especially if you are new to it. We are approaching our Senior lives and we our updated with these kind of technologies due to our sons and daughters but to use this kind of software in the phone is pretty confusing. We gave it 3 stars because of that and one other thing, it heats up easily? We don't know what's the reason but it heats up easily when used during phone calls and charging.

But be warned that it is not a very stable design (steering in front with no skateboard like sway). Even if you put an adult's brain into a 3 y.o., this scooter would not be fun because of its instability (again, design is the issue).

The fabric drawers are not stable in the least, so don't expect to put anything too heavy in them unless you want it to break. The bottom piece is not too stable either.

Not in a good way.<br /><br />I got this headset two months ago, expecting a decent pair for the decent price they were purchased at, yet I received something entirely different.<br /><br />When you use them for anything with even the smallest amount of bass, it sounds horrible. The noise is as if the speaker is rattling and making a static-like sound every time any bass should be apparent. I tried numerous settings but it still continued.<br /><br />I wish I would have done some research before purchasing them because I would have known to get the pair I have now.<br /><br />I have had this new set for about a month and can't find a single thing to complain about.<br /><br />I bought them here on Amazon too ----------&#62; http://amzn.to/181sLOx<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money on these.

The only thing I had a problem with is sometimes it would stay on the ceiling. When in a room with lots of space it would fly fine but I took it to a room that  was crowded and it kept crashing into the walls.Overall, it is a good toy that will delight kids as long as they can control the flyng.

2062	__label1__	4	N	Outdoors	B003BOBF0G	High Sierra Freewheel Wheeled Book Bag Backpack, Black	fits a lot of stuff	Backpack is pretty quiet when rolling, fits a lot of stuff in all the pockets. Wish the main compartment would hold more, seems to tip forward when my laptop is in padded compartment.

This is a spacious cooler which is why I bought and its has a great design with handle and wheels. But pull along handle is a bit flimsy.

I looked at several stores but this is the best price. I have been using these batteries for a few weeks and the solar lights are bright again. I do not know how long the life on these will be, but so far I would recommend them and would purchase them again.
2065	__label1__	3	N	Electronics	B0001FTVEK	Sennheiser RS120 On-Ear Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Dock	Disappointed	A little disappointed, could not program with ease to the cell phone. While listening to music tune, headphone skips in different locations throughout the song. I even tried the same music on a different set of headphones it worked fine.
2066	__label1__	4	N	Electronics	B005JXH1OQ	Polk Audio UltraFit 3000 Headphones - White (ULTRAFIT 3000WHT)	Fantastic feature	They also on great when I'm very active at the gym and are very comfortable when wearing for long periods. Another great feature is anyone can mold the phones to their ears and if you need more length, you've got the option to extend the cord with the different cord lengths that come in the box.
2067	__label1__	3	N	Books	1932735658	PMP Exam Prep, Eighth Edition - Updated: Rita's Course in a Book for Passing the PMP Exam	No more the best one in the market	Rita's book have been in the market for almost 15 years now and I studied it when I took the PMP exam first time in 2007. I got busy and failed to collect 60 PDUs and recently had to sit for the exam again. I was never crazy about Rita's book but when I took the test it was my only option. This time I did a lot of research to find out the best PMP book in the market which not only will help the reader to pass the test but also help them understand real life project management with case studies and scenarios. Below is my finding:    Professor Sohel: This book is the best in every possible way. It is written in a language that anyone can understand and mostly every concept is explained with examples. It has summary tables after every topic which is simply spectacular, questions are exactly what you will see in real life exam, extremely structured and well organized. Loved this book. It's very new in the market so I don't think a lot of ppl know about it yet but I am 100% sure that this one will be the number one PMP book soon.  http://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Professional-Certification-Exam/dp/1492310549/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381180&sr=8-1&keywords=sohel    Rita: I will consider Rita's one the second best in the market. It is some time hard to follow and digest. Questions are not as good as the first one.  Head First: I also like this book because it makes sense and easy to follow.  I think a lot of ppl will not appreciate cartoons and images in a PMP book but I liked it.  Questions are not too good but comparing others it does a good job.  http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-PMP-Jennifer-Greene/dp/1449364918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381221&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+pmp
2068	__label1__	3	N	Furniture	B00584T2I4	Finley Console Table	Not worth the money	I'll start by saying I never do a review unless I feel strongly about a product--one way or the other. In this case, I strongly feel it was not worth the money. There are several places where, for some reason, paper was attached, then not removed before painting, so you peel the paper away and there are spots that aren't painted.
2069	__label1__	3	N	Office Products	B0006HXD6K	Pendaflex Essentials Hanging Folders, Letter Size, 1/5 Cut Tabs, Standard Green, 25 per Box (81602)	it hard to open	Top drawer is dragging which makes it hard to open, I have nothing in the drawer yet but will probably make it worse. A lot more thinly than I thought it would be. Would be a lot better with rollers in the drawers.
2070	__label1__	4	N	Baby	B00ACR8LCU	Baby K'tan ORIGINAL Baby Carrier, Heather Grey, Medium	Good product	It was a good buy, I really like that it's adjustable, and that the form is padded cloth, easy to use pins on. And it was affordable. The base is a little wobbly though.
2071	__label1__	4	N	Furniture	B003VP5TPW	Furinno 99811EX/BK Turn-N-Tube 5 Tier Corner Shelf, Espresso/Black	Great product!	We ordered this for our little boy's nursery and love it! It arrived on time and it great condition. It is really sturdy and looks a lot more expensive than the other corner bookshelves available. It probably took my husband about an hour to put it together. Overall great product!
2072	__label1__	2	N	Home	B000KKIP3Y	Organize It All Can Rack (1866W)	too much to take apart	Same as the quality section above. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I considered returning it to them, but since I had it assembled, it was too much to take apart and put in the box as received.
2073	__label1__	4	Y	Pet Products	B00KRW4YJY	Multivitamin and Mineral Supplement for Dogs - Digestive Enzymes and Antioxidants - 45 Chicken Liver Chews	Great dog vitamin	This vitamin seems great so far.  Has lots of needed vitamins for every dog.  I give 4 stars because they would be better in maybe a plastic jar instead of resealable bag. Also while 2 of my dogs love them.  One sniffs and refuses to touch it at all. Overall great dog vitamin!

I have to say that while there are some good points in this book I disagree with much of what is being encouraged here. To even consider them is disgusting to me and I have three wonderful, responsible and loving children who I've never had to treat the way this book advocates.

Cheap plastic that melts easily	I was excited to start using a tool other than my two regular forks to shred my pulled pork. Unfortunately, this is not the solution to my problem. This is cheap material and not durable. Tips melted, and they were useless.

I saw the great price and decent reviews online and decided to take a risk and purchase a TV that had mixed reviews... Boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for nearly the same price, actually $80 cheaper!.<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out -----&#62; http://amzn.to/SCb3Qp it is here on Amazon. I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!

This is an excellent cam for beginners. And it's a great idea by canon of bundling two lenses at such a great price. Covers both landscape & telephoto requirements. Add a 50mm and you have a complete kit.

Basically if you want something, point yourself in that direction and you will get it. Simple enough. Go for it. The book can be summarized and condensed into the maxim: "go for it"
2083	__label1__	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B000P7FU3A	Coolaroo Market Umbrella Smoke 11-Feet	so good	No surprises. It came within a few days, it looks like it did in the picture and operated fine. The material is a little thin, so I don't think it will provide as much sun protection as I would like, but other than that, so far, so good.

Comes with Jellybean OS on it.  The only downfall for me is that the bootloader is encrypted, meaning that it is unlockable.  Might not be a deal breaker for some, but definitely a deal breaker for me.  Wish I new it before I bought it.

Instead I got a ring that looked dull and cheap. I had read the reviews for this ring and am confused as to what people were looking at as not only was it dull and cheap, the size suggestions were also way off. I will be sending this back for a refund ASAP.

Haven't picked out the rest of the furniture yet, but am hoping that these match whatever I do. They are pretty great because I feel like I could put them just about anywhere if they don't work out where planned.
2094	__label1__	1	N	Lawn and Garden	B00ATZZWQS	Telebrands Pocket Hose, 50-Feet	no good do not buy	Did not even fit on faucet. I tried both of my faucets and then tried my neighbors as well. I put it on as tight as possible and it still squirted water every where. It wouldn't even connect to a hose. It is a shame because I liked the light weight of this hose.
2095	__label1__	2	N	Home	B0027IS1O0	Spasilk 100% Pure Silk Facial Beauty Pillowcase, Standard/Queen, White	Not helpful	I did not find these cases helpful at all, and in fact seem to have worse results. The cases are fine as far as pillowcases go, so if that is all you want, go for it. But if you want them for the reasons I did, I cannot recommend them & that is why I gave them 2 stars.

When it was unwrapped the handle was loose and hanging from the case. The wrapping was not damaged in any way, so the case was damaged when it was sent. Also, the tools do not stay in place when the case is closed.

I emailed the company and was instructed to download the update on their website. I did and it still didn't work! I called the company support and no one ever picks up! I wrote them an email and got a response but they are not very quick at responding. Returning this product and getting something else!
2102	__label1__	3	N	Outdoors	B00ASSQYK4	Allen Sports Deluxe 2-Bike Trunk Mount Rack	Interesting design	I have to admit that the design of this trunk mount rack is at least interesting. First time, I just couldn't believe that it is able to hold 2 bikes. But, yes...it does.<br />In my opinion, the greatest advantage of this trunk mount rack is that it keeps the bikes behind the car and not on top of it, so it you don't have to put too much effort when mounting the bikes. Unfortunately, some effort is required...because my wife wouldn't be able to mount them by herself.<br />The straps are a bit insecure. They could start loosen when driving at higher speeds, so you have to check them once in a while. I don't think that they will loosen completely but it's better to stay on the safer side.

The only problem was that the quality wasn't that good, and the drawer is a little unstable. But for this price it's pretty good. All I needed was a little space to do my homework or use my laptop, and this desk is perfect for that.

However, it is also much less expensive than other shag rugs elsewhere. The smell is terrible, but am hoping that it goes away soon.

Otherwise my grandson loves it and is a good product to have for that teething child.

2155	__label1__	3	N	Books	111828917X	PHR / SPHR: Professional in Human Resources Certification Study Guide	Book is ok	As one previous reviewer pointed out, the question formatting was less than optimal as the questions were at the beginning of each section and subsequently followed by the answers (hard not to cheat). Suggestion - locate the answers at the end of the chapter/text. Also, this may just be me, but the questions should come after the related section's literature not the other way around.<br /><br />Comprehensive but still lacking. When I took the exam I found myself cursing the review book as a great deal of information on the exam was never mentioned in this text. I had to reach into the deep recesses of my mind (sca ry) to retrieve some gray/foggy/probably incorrect information to answer some of the questions. Now, I know that cramming two years of full time graduate study into so many pages isn't feasible. So, I would suggest to future candidates to briefly (and I mean briefly) skim their graduate texts before dedicating majority of their time to this text.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that it was weird to have the practice questions in the beginning of each chapter, and that it doesn't give you a clear idea on how you do on the content unless you're really good at the honor system.<br /><br />What helped me the most were these 2 books<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/SPHR-Exam-Prep-Professional-Resources/dp/0789736764/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1344537422&sr=8-4&keywords=sphr<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BABSJW

Since this product has over 70 5 star reviews within a matter of weeks I felt further investigation was in order.<br /><br />I researched the profiles of the reviewers and found a lot of weird &#34;coincidences&#34;. Reviewers leave nothing but 5-star ratings but what's really strange is how different reviewers review the same unrelated products and reviewers review multiple of the same type of product.<br />For example one reviewer reviewed over 20 different iphone cases within a month and all reviews talked about how great it protected their phone. Then you'll see things like 10 different weight loss bottles of Garcinia Cambodia reviewed in the same 2 week span.<br /><br />Just didn't make sense to me so I decided not to purchase this product since the reviews can obviously not be trusted.&#34;

I had this kit for a couple years now, it is not a dremel by no means but the quality is ok and the price is amazing, so basically you get what you pay for and more, its got a little bit of everything so its very comprehensive and a great starter kit for a beginner, I highly recommend this to someone starting out.<br /><br />I only gave it 3 stars rating because its a little on the cheap side but for the money its well worth it, but if I was going to buy again I would the 500pc set I have linked here, I've seen it at a friends place and its comprehensive and a surprisingly good quality and looks kick@$$ [[ASIN:B00CVZSLR6 500pc Rotary Tool Accessories Set (kit) Bits Fits Dremel for Cutting Grinding Sanding Polishing]]

(Discontinued by manufacturer)	solid 10 min of quiet time	This maze was a part of the present my daughter got for her 9th birthday. She was really trying and was really persistent for 10 minutes straight. But then somehow it starts getting on he nerves and she is ready to through it into the wall. It's funny to watch her being so frustrated with... herself. But again, I think it makes her more patient with every try. She doesn't quit. Love that there are toys that develop those good qualities in kids.

Saw this at the store picked up a bag there.  This also gave him terrible diarrhea first few times he ate this.  Good size for training treats.  I probably wont be buying any more.

2204	__label1__	3	N	Home Entertainment	B007B5WIJ8	Philips HTS3541/F7 3D Blu-ray 5.1 Home Theater System	No surround sound	Lousy home theater system, due to having only composite audio out, nothing digital.

When the pillows were delivered, i couldn't wait to go to sleep that night. I found myself getting my old pillows out at 3:00am. Every time I moved in bed the pillows would crackle like i was sleeping on plastic. Not a good buy! I would not recommend these to anyone!!!

So I got him this to take up his interest and it worked. Now, he won't chew on anything harder than my shoes, which is another problem to deal with.

I simply unplug it from the wall power socket and then reconnect it so that it starts rotating. This happens everyday. I can't really tell how long it rotates before it stops. It's really frustrating though because 2 or 3 days later I find my watch stopped then I manually have to shake it and adjust date/time. This device looks good but cheap motor.

Makes a great inexpensive gift that you know they will use.
2217	__label1__	3	N	Tools	B00327HT5W	Nebo Ultra Socket Combination Kit	useless	First, the sockets that came with this set are metric which makes them all but useless to me. Second, that fat round ratcheting swiveling head on the driver makes it very front heavy. It won't matter if you are pointing it downward and turning it but when using it in the horizontal position it can be a real pain.

I live in South Dakota so all summer get hot and it is like a oven near the ears when i wear it. the only good thing i like about this is the padding they are so confusable.

Enzo matcha is made in China. I saw a great article on GREEN TEA GUIDE dot com that warned that Chinese Matcha may be unhealthy due to high levels of heavy metal lead!!! Here is a small part of the article:<br /><br />&#34;CHINESE MATCHA could have SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES since the lead content in Chinese tea leaves is so high and you are consuming the unfiltered leaf. Be sure to ask where your matcha comes from before you buy.&#34;<br /><br />It's worth checking out the article!<br /><br />BTW, the author also said that: &#34;The Japanese tea leaves did not have any tea leaves that exceeded the limit.&#34;<br /><br />I think Japanese matcha is healthier. I thought you might find this article useful.

It's not super sturdy, but the individual boxes pull in and out easily for him to spread out on the floor and then put back up when he's finished building.

The lighter has some heft to it, the case is a nice brushed aluminum which is appealing... so why go through all the effort to make it sturdy and then put a plastic tip on the end to hold the igniter?!<br /><br />The tip will melt, mine made it through the original tank of gas and half of a second before it wouldn't light as the igniter tip has melted into the cap.<br /><br />Yes, the igniter needs to be insulated from the aluminum body of the lighter however silicone or a better designed tip should be a no brainier for a lighter that is $10+ dollars.

I could not believe that they only needed to be charged once a week.  After 15 days of use my Samsung 4 and the headset are dropping the Bluetooth connection when the phone is in my pocket and the headset is around my neck.<br /><br />I have tried everything reboot phone, shut off headset, charge head set, charge phone.  nothing seems to work.  this happens in my home where it used to work fine.  I have to give it one star because it should work over 15 days.  The company must know there is a problem.<br /><br />You will see others that have the same problem with the headset.  Now for the hassle of returning.

While it is very sturdy the picture shows a table with six chairs (which is what we ordered) but the table is only large enough for four chairs. The table top also came with a slight ding on the top. The chairs that go with the table are beautiful and quite sturdy though.

2243	__label1__	4	Y	Automotive	B004YHOB5U	Chemical Guys HOL_182 Foam Blaster Complete Car Wash Kit Foam System (8 Items)	Great except the foam gun	This was my first time using Chemical Guys products and I was pleasantly surprised. The cleaners work well and leave your car nice and squeaky clean. The citrus cleaner is the best cleaner, good for washing the car the day you plan to wax it. The gloss-works is best for cleaning a lightly soiled car, but does leave it wetter looking than the other washes. The big jug which I guess is a mix of the two runs right down the middle on cleaning power and gloss. The gloves are of good quality, particularly the microfiber glove. Those tend to fall apart or mold quickly here in Florida, but this one is still going strong.<br /><br />But the foam sprayer is of poor quality.<br />When this thing worked, it was great and I plan to buy another one, but will seek out a different brand. When I first got it, there was a missing part on the foamer (the hose/strainer that sucks up the soap). I called chemical guys directly to see if they would send me a replacement. They were very friendly and sent me one at no cost that arrived in only a few days. I was pretty impressed since I had actually purchased this through a third party vendor. The foamer worked like a champ for the first couple of months, but started leaking shortly after that. Then, the trigger started sticking so you couldn't stop the flow of foam. It became unusable within 6 months.

When I took the exam I found myself cursing the review book as a great deal of information on the exam was never mentioned in this text. I had to reach into the deep recesses of my mind (scary) to retrieve some gray/foggy/probably incorrect information to answer some of the questions. Now, I know that cramming two years of full time graduate study into so many pages isn't feasible. So, I would sugg est to future candidates to briefly (and I mean briefly) skim their graduate texts before dedicating majority of their time to this text.<br /><br />What i used to study were these 2 books:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Phlebotomy-Worktext-Procedures-Manual-2e/dp/1416000356/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1344539095&sr=8-6&keywords=Phlebotomy<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PJF9LY

2250	__label1__	2	Y	Books	0805092439	The Reapers Are the Angels: A Novel	Hard to read -	Very disappointing. The author chose not to use quotation marks which seemed weird to me, especially with so much inner dialogue. Sometime I didn't know if the main character was speaking or thinking and had to re-read in several spots.  It just seems lazy to me and I don't understand why someone would use this format. That's not why I'm giving the book 2 stars though. The author seemed to create a fairly realistic world, but then totally dropped the ball in several spots.  For instance it seemed like nearly every character spoke like a redneck. Maybe the author is implying that only the rednecks will survive... Ha ha, but I don't know. The girl, a 15 year old that can't even remember what the world was like before it all happened leads me to believe it's been at least 10 years, yet she is able to find cheese crackers on a shelf in a store. I'm pretty sure that after 10 years there would be no food on the shelf and it certainly wouldn't be eatable. She was also fortunate to find Coke in a few occasions. Never Pepsi or Dr. Pepper.  The most unrealistic thing about the book was that she was driving all over the country filling up her gas tank whenever she ran low.  I found this totally unbelievable since most gas stations would be empty after 10 hours, but here she is 10 years later.  Anyway, the story was just okay, I liked the 15 year old girl and even cheered for her. Several characters I could see clearly in my mind.  The author has talent and I enjoyed his descriptive writing style, just not the story.  I had to force myself to finish and I didn't like the ending.

They are ugly and tight and horrible. That doesn't mean I don't need one so I always look out for the best one there is. I hate the tightness of the swim cap above all. This is why I found this cap from swimculture and decided to try it out. I can't really go to the pool without a cap, because they put lots of chlorine in the waters. It's because so many people visit the pool I bet and many of them are ladies that would clog the whole place up with all the hair.<br /><br />I like this cap because it is very elastic at least. I still look just as ridiculous like all people wearing swim caps (like an alien), but at least I am more comfortable than most of them. My cap is totally smooth and sleek black, so it doesn't draw any attention. My ears and head didn't hurt at all after wearing my cap, so you can see that it is very elastic and nice to wear. If you absolutely have to wear a swim cap at least buy one that is comfortable like this one on this site.

It was meant to be more as a stylish book-bag than anything else. My dad is going to have to get something else for his birthday, because this certainly isn't something I can see him carrying around. What a bummer. I hope they'll give me my money back.

2260	__label1__	4	Y	Video Games	B00TEDK8FQ	Ortz PS4 Vertical Stand with Cooling Fan - Controller Charging Station with Dual Charger	Good enough to have	The charging is great, the usb hub is great, the stand works great and doesn't fall over but the fans aren't exactly placed well at all. Instead of pulling the hot air out of the ps4 it blows it back in, while the console is already trying to push the hot a or out so, hot air gets trapped inside of your PlayStation and your console will overheat. My ps4 actually broke because of this reason. But if you open up the stand and flip the fans around it fixes the problem. So do not turn the fans on unless you have flipped them around or else it will ruin your PlayStation and costs $150 to send it to Sony for repairs. But aside from that it's really great and I will continue to use it once my ps4 is shipped back to me!!!

It was a bit tricky to get this set up, but I managed to get it situated near my front door and the first evening I was amazed by it--both the motion sensor and the *sound* sensor actually worked. Loved that I could walk up to my front door, rattle my keys near it and it would just turn on. I believe that had to be the coolest feature I'd ever seen on a light. However, it was shortlived because it stopped working properly on the second night. (The other died on the third night.)<br /><br />I first noticed that the sound detection wasn't working properly, although the motion detection was. I didn't think much of it because I could live with it even without the sound detection. By the end of the week, the light stopped working entirely. To make sure it wasn't just in a bad location, I cleaned the solar panel and deliberately put it out in the sunniest location on my property I could find, and since I'm in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight. Still, no love.<br /><br />It was great while it lasted, unfortunately it just didn't last very long.

It was bearable, though irritating, at first, but when I ran 6 miles yesterday, I have been in severe pain since then. Just putting on a shirt is painful due to the inflammation on the skin.

I owned Turtle Beaches before with my Xbox 360 and decided to be a returning customer.<br /><br />My old headset was comfortable and worked well, I loved the bass you could hear with them.<br /><br />When I tried these I was definitely unhappy... The speakers would make an unbearable noise that sounded like rattling most of the time, even at lower volumes. If this wasn't bad enough, one speaker kept cutting out. I had to bang on the side to get it to start working again.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't enjoy these and can't imagine why they are charging so much for them.<br /><br />After this depressing experience I did some serious research and found a headset I absolutely LOVE.<br /><br />It's been over a month and I can't find anything to complain about.

BUYER BEWARE!	I have had years of professional experience in testing batteries, from aerospace to hearing aid batteries. I know how to test batteries & I have the equipment. I tested these based on the standard slow 20 hour discharge rate, not a high rate which makes the batteries look even worse.<br /><br />This battery company is basically running something like a scam. I bought a total of 6 of these at 2 different times. My tests show that on average, they don't even measure up to a 1/3 of the 3000 mAh level claimed by UltraFire. One went totally dead after using only once.<br /><br />Furthermore, they only have about the same power level as found in a triple pack of AAA batteries.<br /><br />Therefore, buying these batteries makes no sense at all. Save yourself time & trouble & stay with lights that use the triple pack of AAA batteries. Keep it simple......
2286	__label1__	2	N	Books	0892762578	I Went to Hell	The effect of this stuff on a once normal mind	Actually the belief that "Hell is for Real" isn't a funny matter. It's devastating for many children (and adults). Most people who suffer from depression and bipolar disorder have a fixation on the idea of eternal pain.<br /><br />Fear of Hell is the price most Christians pay for accepting the promises of Jesus. You can't have one without the other. This book focuses on the culmination of Jesus' threats. There is another book that describes the lifelong affect those threats have on a young man. It serves well as counterpoint to "Hell Is for Real."<br /><br />"How to Stop Believing in Hell" is the autobiography of a very peculiar person who tries to commit the unforgivable sin to escape the threats of Jesus. In it the author describes the messes he gets into trying to rid himself of his decades long fear of Hell. The story should interest similarly peculiar people among many others.<br /><br />"How to Stop Believing in Hell" starts with a barrage of shocking blasphemies once shouted by the author at the lunch-breaking denizens of the Congressional office buildings in Washington,, D.C. After a series of adventures, the author reconciles himself with God, who delivers him from his conscience and every other vestige of morality. The author is then free to commit suicide, a fate he has longed for since childhood. In the end the happy author is "a man on a ledge enjoying the fresh air."
2287	__label1__	3	N	Books	1432799320	Life Lessons from Nature: Motivational Speaker, Military Strategist, Political Advisor, Scientist & Engineer, Foster Parent	Good... but it could be better !!!	I never think that we can gain much knowledge from Nature until I read this book. There are such a large number of incredible lessons of how we ought to carry on with our life the way we are intended to live. It is a short book yet notwithstanding it being so concise, it has taught us the genuine significance of life. I truly like the thought that the writer introduces in his book of how human race is worried about their life and how each of us is in a rodent race, what he calls, throughout today's life. In the wake of perusing this book, I had the capacity carry on with my life at the fullest and understood the easily overlooked details that we have a tendency to overlook and pass up a major opportunity in our occupied routine are the genuine satisfaction of life.  My just concern in regards to this book is that it required about more human related illustrations and less creature related ones. Yet other than that, this book shows us the things you would not typically get the chance to learn. So 3 stars from me.

Then, it started to take a lot of time to recharge the battery to 100%. Now, after 6-7 hours my phone is just 80% recharged. At the beginning I thought that the charger itself has issues, but, when connecting the phone to my laptop, through this cable, it doesn't recharge well, either: the same problem...after 6-7 hours it stops recharging even if it has reached the level of 80%.<br />I tried to recharge my phone with a standard Samsung charger (without USB cable), and the recharge level easily gets to 100%.<br />So, in my opinion, the cable is the source of all problems.

They pop into the walls but only on on side. She didn't seem to mind that much though. I thought it was a bit strange after I finally figured out it is one-sided holes.<br /><br />The second thing about this set that sticks out is the sink that comes with it. It is cute and the idea is great and all, but it doesn't seem to have much use. My 6-yr-old daughter plays as if it isn't there. She does like the mask that came with the Little Pet Shop set. I was surprised that it actually does stay on the pet!<br /><br />The last thing about it that I have noticed - The wall mount on the bottom right (which is small cardboard) doesn't flatten out well so you can't really sit anything on it. I am unsure why they included this small &#34;surprise&#34; instead of just including a small side table or long-standing table.<br /><br />I would still recommend this to other parents but not without telling them about these things just in case. I was a bit disappoint by this set.

The box itself looks like it had taken quite a beating during shipping, so this may have lead to my light not working, I can't be sure. But the online vendor I bought it from did not respond to my requests for a refund. I eventually found the manufacturer here on amazon and just as a last ditch effort sent them a message explaining my plight. To my surprise I received a phone call from a  real live human being the next day! He was extremely congenial and apologized for my recent experience and assured me I had either received a defective unit or that it was indeed damaged on its way to me. He offered to replace it with no further questions and I was really surprised - needless to say I can't rate the headlight itself yet, but I wanted to post SOMETHING now and once I get the replacement I will update my review. Kudos to a company that still displays a little old fashioned customer service.

It's annoying to see that such a brand is producing now devices that fail to lock the GPS signal in an open field. It doesn't do this all the time, but it is certainly doing when I urgently need the device to work.

2317	__label1__	1	N	Toys	B00C6VJMNW	Doc McStuffins Check Up 'N Go Mobile Playset	A fool and his money are soon parted	A present thankfully, and yes, it lit my girls eyes up when she saw she can just press a button and like magic make something move, especially her favorite character.<br /><br />Unless you have all hardwood flooring, don't bother, and even on our hardwood flooring its buggy. Not sure if we got a defective product or what, but after 4 sets of batteries, its now in its final resting place  the upstairs closet toy box.<br /><br />And actually thinking back now, she actually was getting frustrated by this thing, it just goes straight, and back, but when it backs up it does so at an angle, I assume to go in a different direction, THIS is the frustrating part. Unless your child is using this in a 1000 square foot room that is all hard flooring and NO furniture, and assuming you child has the patience of Gandhi, this thing will just reverse into something, then you can only go forward, which again, bangs into something else, then reverse, at an angle, and then bangs into something again, and so the cycle continues till your child will probably run over to it and turn it in the direction to go straight again, unless they have brains of an adult and actually understands how to maneuver it, which is highly unlikely. With the amount of tech out there, one has to wonder why such limited driving capacities where applied. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED.
2318	__label1__	4	N	Musical Instruments	B00COC606A	ION Party Starter Portable Bluetooth Speaker With Built-In Light Show	Quality sound	I think that the sound is superb, and its very easy to hook both my android phone as well as my ipod to the speaker.<br />The sound resinates through both my living room and kitchen. (about 500 sq. feet.)As for the light effects, i would rate them at modest. They are a fun addidtion, i just don't think the light resinates very well. So it would be ideal for a small room such as a bedroom.

2333	__label1__	1	N	Sports	B000VCDXNS	CAP Barbell 40-pound Adjustable Dumbbell Set with Case	WARNING, READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!!!!!!	I got this hoping to get a decent set at home but it didn't turn out that way. First, the smell of this set is nothing short of toxic. The chemical smell they come with is nauseating and fills an entire room. I tried wiping them down but it didn't seem to help and after some inspection noticed there was a warning label about the chemicals used being linked to cancer and birth defects. Also, the kit doesn't even come with enough weight to even reach 40 lbs. I weighed all the weights and they equal 38 lbs, which is with the 4 lb bar itself.<br /><br />After getting rid of these I got myself a set of dumbbells I absolutely love. I got them around a month ago and I can't find a single thing to complain about. The max weight and combination of weights included are endless. I'm so happy I bought the set.<br /><br />If you want a quality set of dumbbells, then get the same set I did here on Amazon ---------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r0BiNN<br /><br />I hope I could help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!
2334	__label1__	4	N	Watches	B000PSQXWG	Nautica Men's N14536 NST Stainless Steel Watch with Black Resin Band	seems to be a good watch	I bought the Nautica chronograph N14536G a couple of days ago. Prompt delivery. Received the watch in good condition. The watch itself looks as good as it does on the screen... a good, solid watch... sporty looks and feel. Some might think it is heavy, which it probably is, but I have no problems there. My main complain is that the manual that comes with the watch is useless... does not have specifications/ help for this particular model. Also the seconds hand is the tiny dial at the 6 O'Clock position and the main "seconds" dial is for the stop watch, which I find weird in a watch.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a good buy, if you don't mind a heavy watch. I even got a pair of Nautica binoculars free!! And no one can beat Amazon's price.
2335	__label1__	1	N	Toys	B00N8GVOE4	Wubble Bubble Ball Purple - No Pump	JUNK	It's a piece of junk!  My son had seen the commercials for what looked like such a fun and exciting new toy. I was thrilled to find one at Target. It ended up being such a let down....My son's spirits were as deflated as this stupid balloon.  I bought one at Target (for a fraction of the cost that people are asking on Amazon and eBay). I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles. How convenient! They include a note: "Lifetime replacement warranty" "Do not return to the retailer." Only problem, they want $7 "handling fee." Plus the cost of postage to mail it back, which ended up costing me another $5. So, that was a total of $12 to get a replacement.

I purchased this TV last month as a living room TV. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret buying it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming very quickly as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, one of the HDMI ports proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. I tried to deal with it for as long as I could but then decided this wasn't what I paid for.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.<br /><br />After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for much CHEAPER!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY 60 inch TV, check this one out here on Amazon -------&#62; http://amzn.to/1ozWTLS<br /><br />I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here. Please, save yourself the time and frustration that I put myself through!<br /><br />If you do decide this isn't the TV for you, at least I got to share my experience with this one!

Easy it is to use	These are applied the exterior glass on your car and the manufacturer claims that they can dramatically improve you wet weather driving visibility without window wipers. Well, I don't know about dramatically but they certainly do improve the visibility through windows when wet weather driving.<br /><br />I must say I was impressed with how easy it is to install. When we had a down pour recently I hardly had to use the wipers. One thing to note however, don't put this on your side windows as I did  because you will have all the water rushing in if you crack them open for any reason.<br /><br />This even works on glass shower doors and stops them from steaming up as frequently, which reduces how often I have to clean the shower.

I put my pendant piece on it, (which I purchased the chain for, BTW) and I was initially unsure whether they looked okay together, as my diamond/heart-shaped piece could not compare to the shine of the chain, INITIALLY anyway. After a few, (maybe 2-3 months) of use, the shine and sparkle quickly faded and became dull and quite frankly, embarrassing to wear. I am not usually disappointed with my jewelry from them, but this was just that, a BIG disappointment!

The rack was easy to install and it had no problem holding up my bike. I just got a 2 because my girlfriend's moving in and she has a mountain bike. I don't think it'll have any problems with holding up 2 bikes, but I'll just have to wait and see.

But to buy it fresh from the farm is so expensive, so this is a great substitute. I started my kids on this when I stopped nursing and they've loved it ever since. They eat it in their cereal and drink it straight from the cup. I think goat's milk is the next best thing to breast milk!

It was purchased to use for camping. It was charged for 36 hours per instruction and it worked really well blowing up one of our air mattress but half way through the second it kept cutting out, it would not even work for the third.

Instead, I went to my cupboard and got out "The Big Chill." Now that's a reunion movie. That's a movie with characters you care about. There were no characters in this one that I cared enough about to keep watching. I made it about halfway, then quit. If there was a story or a plot, I missed it.

This is only a cosmetic problem, but I feel like they should have at least reinforced the area with a strip of electrical tape or foil that would block the light. These controllers are too expensive to have cosmetic defects.

My husband can use it as well and I think although it did not indicate that it is unisex, it really is. The material used or the fabric is cotton and I like the color which is suitable for most sporty attire. I am gonna use this more specially  now that summer is almost here. It can be great protection for the face plus it looks cool for me.

Returning the bulb was a hassle and not worth the time. I got my refund and went with a different bulb here on Amazon that STILL WORKS after three months.

The only qualm I have with this briefcase is that it does not have dividers for your papers and folders, although there is a front pocket for those kinds of things. Other than that, it is a perfect product and is highly recommended by me.

I'll keep them as a backup, but I immediately went out and bought a new set.

The spooler occasionally snags which is a problem with a small dog. Either I am dragging the extra leash until I fix it or it is too tight for the dog to extend the leash. It' a good product bot not a perfect one.

I'm nice too, just not happy.<br /><br />We've had a Paderno spiral slicer since 2012 and get great use out of it.<br />Last week we decided to buy a 2nd spiral slicer for the cabin since we are spending more time up there these days. I told my wife to buy this one because of the good reviews, especially the one from top reviewer RWM.<br />We got it and took our usual bunch of vegetables up and besides the softest ones, the Briefton was not capable enough. Just too flimsy and blades not sharp enough. Ruined our dinner and wife blamed me for choosing it of course.<br /><br />We are returning it but it really should have NEVER been ranked equal or higher than the Paderno!<br /><br />Hope his helps others from wasting their time.

It works fine. I have noticed that its thicker than synthetic M-1. My mechanical oil pressure gauge runs 5-7 psi higher on this oil in my F-150 with the same 5w30 weight oil. I have also used it in my V-6 montero as well. I change my oil every 7k miles and normally I have to add 2x as much as normal synthetic (M1, syntec, Val) at 3-4k miles to get me to the 7k change. I definitely notice both my engines consuming more of this oil than normal synthetic. I am from the school of lower viscosity (higher flow oil) and less burning oil so if the price is the same I usually go somewhere else.

2520	__label1__	4	N	Tools	B000FJQQVI	Ready America 70280 Emergency Kit, 2-Person, 3-Day Backpack	emergency kit..	We don't know what will happen. We don't have the power to predict future events. I always want to make sure that I'm ready with tragedies or any emergency situations. It's hard to neglect this kind of situations. This emergency kit is for two persons and would last for 3 days. It is a complete survival kit.

They loved the fact that they worked well and they could be easily attached to our kit.
2522	__label1__	2	N	Kitchen	B000094Y17	Brita 42556 Grand Pitcher	Most annoying	Most annoying, the small cover that effectively seals the spout would suction itself on once wet and when we tried to pour, water would leak around it or actually cause the lid to fly off and water to go everywhere. We even tried creating a notch in the plastic cover, but to no avail. This one with no cover obviously solves that issue. Only slightly less annoying, the carbon bits that would leak down into the main pitcher. So far, no bits. Two thumbs up.

Great items in total.
2524	__label1__	3	N	Jewelry	B002AQSSVA	Sterling Silver Multi Pressed Flower Teardrop Earrings	Average Jewelry	To me, these earrings looked like any average cubic zirconia jewelry in the silver rack in most department stores. In real life it's a big main stone and the outer circle is smaller than appears in the picture. It does not look like fine jewelry or diamonds. However main stone produces a lot of sparkle and the earrings are sturdy and well done.

I have been playing one of these for a while now. I love it but...  As with most hollow bodies it goes out of tune after heavy string bending leads.  This model IS MUCH MUCH better than most because of its through body solid design, which is why its called a semi-hollow body.  If you dont play bluesy bendy leads this is as good as any guitar out there. If you do. Keep a second 6 string by the stage so when you come out of that solo you are playinbg diminished chords...lmao

2537	__label1__	2	N	Books	0316038385	Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)	Dear author!	As I'm sure the other 6,000 reviews told you, vampires don't sparkle. Actually I'm pretty sure vampires don't exist. Nor do huge wolves which was an obvious attempt on your part to appeal to the native american people in hopes of garnishing their support in making you works reach best seller status.<br /><br />I would suggest you remove these myths from the book, which would shorten the 4 book series to one novella. In fact, if you just had Bella die from her head injury from that volleyball in gym class, we would be spared a lot of unnecessary whining and melodrama, and could go on to enjoy real cult classics like 'Vamp, the alien sex goddess masquerading as Wonder Woman.'<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />your number two and half fan,<br />TheReviewNutt

2551	__label1__	4	N	Video DVD	B003LL3N1I	Saving Private Ryan (Sapphire Series)  [Blu-ray]	Gary	This movie has the most brutal and graphic violence you are likely to ever see. If you have any question of whether war is inhuman, see this movie to set yourself straight. It chronicles several strangers, forced to waste their lives on a pointless mission. We see how brutal and fruitless war is. The movie shows us good people and bad people (in predictable roles on both sides of the fighting). The direction and filmography are similar to Band of Brothers (for obvious reason). It is technically and visually excellent.<br /><br />The failing of the movie, I believe, is that it can't compare to The Thin Red Line in terms of message(both came out the same year). Although clearly showing that ''war is bad,'' Ryan fails to show us the underlying cause (people, even good people, are corrupt and inhuman). We see bad people do bad things, and good people do good things in this movie. See the Thin Red Line, and feel that not only is war bad, but humanity in general is brutish and terrible.

It's easy to use, and seems very accurate. I've not had it long enough to comment on durability, but it seems OK. The buttons all seem to be tight and to be making the proper contact with their counterparts. That it will also meter for flash brings bonus functionality to the old camera.

2555	__label1__	1	N	Video Games	B00002ST7F	Sonic the Hedgehog 2	MARIO WILL ALWAYS BE LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF SONIC!	The truth is Sega hasn't couldn't escalate after Genesis. In fact, Sonic had to carry them & Nintendo was the one who made Sega popular by being their rival; which Nintendo was & STILL is light years ahead of washed up Sega so it was no comparison.<br /><br />Sega is aware of how crappy their company is cause in the 90s they swore they would never team up with Nintendo; but now they barely make just games instead of garbage systems & even team up with Nintendo so once again Nintendo would save them. The only good game in the Sonic series was Sonic 3+Sonic & Knuckles & that was just average. Sonic 1 was ok but overrated & lacks replay value, Sonic 2 was extremely easy & overrated as well, Sonic 3 was too short & a waste of time. Instead of just going ahead & releasing the full game of Sonic 3, Sega wanted to make a money grab; the other Sonic games pretty much sucked.

So I said to myself get her something like an iPad but for kids" so I wound up getting this.  IF we didn't have any iPads, I think she would have continued to love it, but we had iPads and soon found that it wasn't an iPad" so she still would take ours.<br />I ended up getting her an iPad Mini with an Otterbox Defender case. The Leapfrog itself is, in my opinion, not worth the price, I bought one for $170 at the time, the screen is really not that great, the resolution sucks, the games are just as expensive as Apple apps are, and though it can take a beating as she does still play with it ONCE in a while, spend the extra cash and get an iPad mini with a VERY good case, and child proof it with passwords, the leapfrog is very child friendly in terms of them not being able to access the internet, only a special" internet, that was the only real plus.

It's VERY readable and bright so underwater and it's manageable even with thin gloves on. I think it's a score for it's capabilities and it's price.

Then when we went to put it together, the pieces didn't fit properly and one of the pegs went all the way through from the inside to the finished side. It was a mess!

First, it reads like an essay written by a high school student; the author is clearly not a writer, and I'm surprised it made it to publication in this format. Secondly, it spends a significant portion of time singing the praises of  The Caring Pregnancy Center, in Minnesota. That place has been caught on film telling scared, pregnant young women that abortion can lead to breast cancer. It's shameful to promote an organization that lies to girls to promote its anti-woman agenda. While the information on deaf history and culture in the U.S. is interesting, I would not recommend this book to others.

I just dip it in my cooler that has ice in it and put it around my neck.<br /><br />It also helps with minor aches and pains.  I sprained my ankle a few weeks ago and this helped keep the swelling down until I could get home and treat it with my warrior mist pain spray [[ASIN:B00A347MD6 Warrior Mist Pain Reliever + FREE Vivazen Pain Killer Shot]].<br /><br />Our whole softball team has bought these and everybody we play against always wants to use them and know where we got them from.

Although it the cord states a 2 yr warranty, I noticed that there is a very short return window on Amazon.

I would definitely buy another one for our living room and children's room. My children and wife really liked these lights.

Some sort of lock would be useful as would reference numbers so you could see the setting. Better yet would two push buttons, one for louder and one for quieter.

These were a fraction of the cost of the more popular chairs, a French cafe style chair that I've been wanting to purchase. I love them and they suit our space beautifully.

This bag looks better and the handles are very well attached so that I have no thought of them pulling away -- which is an important feature to me. Drawback is that there is very little room inside for other things.

We live in a pretty safe cul-de-sac so they're forever taking turns zipping up and down the road with it. Right out of the box it seemed sturdy and well-suited for us. My kids are average weight for their age so there's not much problem with lagging or anything. We also make sure to keep it charged up and the tires seem like they'll last quite a while although I'm already prepared to buy new ones if need be. If only it ran a little longer each use, it would be perfect!

They're thinner than the two I bought two summers ago. These two don't cut the heat or sun exposure much. You'll still need sunscreen and sunglasses when sitting under them. Also, I wish the description had mentioned that the poles are black; they look tacky with the beige stands I'd bought for the previous two (which had beige poles).<br />If you're looking for umbrellas that give true sun and heat protection, these aren't it. I do like the very bright, saturated yellow color. These won't fade as quickly as the previous two, most likely.

I can say that this camera isn't the best when it comes to durability because after 3.5 years of service, my 7D just stopped working. I don't know why, I treated it like a baby since it's my first DSLR. Now I don't know what to do, it's already out of warranty and might be costly if I send it to Canon for repair. I had 60K actuation and it never fail me before, but know this happened and don't know what to do. I tried all known methods/tricks to give back it's power but nothing worked.<br /><br />This camera can give you the level of pixels you expect for 18MP and the fast performance when it comes to focusing. However, you should know that you also need a good lens to get sharp images, trust me. Use prime lenses. they're tact sharp. zoom lenses have sweet spots but when you use prime lens you'll get what you want!<br /><br />If you really want a DSLR that will last I think you should change your mind and get an inexpensive model instead and just invest in lenses. DSLRs have a life span and you'll regret if you spend a lot of money on a full frame or a semi pro DSLRs and after 3+ years it will be dead and unusable. I've been there, trust me.

But how does it actually look when you bought it? Let me point out a few things why some of us here are disappointed about this product.<br />- The color of the pillow stains with each other so it really gives this BEAUTIFUL daybed a huge mess<br />- The cushion covers are sewn backwards. Yes, backyards, so as a result, it doesn't look good.<br />- Colors easily fade! It doesn't look good after a few weeks of use or a month or more, so it is really disappointing.<br />- It's not easy to clean unlike the other daybeds out there. The cushions are really hard to remove and as I've said, colors fade and stain other cloth.<br />Overall, it's really annoying. Not worth the money.

I think the watch is really pretty and looks so beautiful and gold. Um, only thing that disappointed me about this watch is it did not come in a box! :( lol It was wrapped in bubble wrap. I wanted it to come in a box because I was buying it as a gift for my aunt and everyone knows I can't give her a watch without a box! It will look used. :) Anyways.. I talked with the sellers about that concern I had and they were very understanding and dealt with me very patiently, prompt and professional. So, "Lovers2009" are indeed excellent sellers to deal with when you have concerns.<br /><br />This all being said, the watch does NOT look cheap in anyway and is so worth the 6 bucks, it is such a steal for the look. I received it ticking and in great condition. Oh and one last thing worth mentioning if I were to use it, it did not fit on my wrist. Keep in mind your wrist size, I would say this is for women with big wrists. Sorry girls, unless you want to scoot the watch up like on your arm to let it fit. I hope my review is helpful. Thanks! If you want to see a personal photo I took of the watch please e-mail me at Hebakadadah33@gmail.com. It won't let me post pictures on this review! Thanks!

It worked for quite a while actually and it was great, but then it just stopped working one day and never turned on again. We had it cleaned and fixed, but there was nothing. Such a shame.
